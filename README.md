Description
===========
The core idea of this project is to visualize the evolution of various genres of western music (mostly US, Europe and parts of Africa) on a geographical plane over a timeline. It feeds on the linked data obtained primarily from MusicBrainz, DBPedia and Last.fm.

This is a mini project, done as part of ESWC Summerschool 2013 by _TooLate_ team:

* Ge Song
* Gopala Krishna Koduri
* Michael Petychakis
* Patrick Philipp
* Zaenal Akbar
