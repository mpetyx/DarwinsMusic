Ginell\n \n L. Shankar\u2019s Vision is an ethereal tour-de-force \u2014 an oxymoron, perhaps, but an appropriate description of the otherworldly visions he conjures with his manipulations of his 10-string, stereophonic, double-necked, electric violin. The lengthy title track is a solo space journey on his massive instrument, with lots of phasing undercurrents and an aural experience of weightlessness that is rather pleasant. On the other tracks, Shankar is flanked by the hot, piercing Jan Garbarek on saxes and the cool Palle Mikkelborg on trumpet and flugelhorn, who contribute heat and ice to Shankar\u2019s textures. \u201cAll For You\u201d is a no-man\u2019s-land of sound that uses Indian scales and minimalist repetition. \u201cPsychic Elephant\u201d finds Garbarek and Mikkelborg revolving around Shankar\u2019s pizzicato violin, and then the two horn players provide percussion for Shankar\u2019s dialogues with himself and Garbarek\u2019s growls on the rare bass saxophone. Exotic pan-cultural ingredients and all, Vision is reassuringly easy to listen to, undoubtedly aided by ECM\u2019s sweetly reverberant sound.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Song title: Watching You (Track No. 3)\n Track length: 13:17\n Artist: Shankar\n Composer: Shankar\n Album: Song for Everyone\n Recording Date: September 1984\n Label: ECM\n Total Time: 50:30\n Genre: * Jazz; * World Fusion; * Post-Bop\n AMG Album ID: R 147256  Other releases:  Year Type Label Catalog #\n CD ECM 823795-2\n ECM 1286\n CD ECM 823795\n 1990 CD ECM 823795\n 2000 CD ECM 823795\n 2006 LP Ecm 1286\n 2008 CD ECM 001183002  \n Album review by Richard S.
