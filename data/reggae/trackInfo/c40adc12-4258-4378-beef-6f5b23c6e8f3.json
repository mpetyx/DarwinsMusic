With live versions though, I find that they're better as long as you're very familiar with the studio version.", "great song", "http://www.lyricsmaza.com/song_list.php?fid=66 \nAlso Songs Lyrics", "http://youtu.be/HN302S_omF4 this video should be on this page! :)", "The later version with the guitar solo is better, if anything for that solo alone.", "Who is she?", "Ficou \u00d3TIMA esta vers\u00e3o :D", "I love this version, especially the horns, hand drums and tons of heavy reverb!  Even a little ad-lib toasting and warbling vocals.", "This version is nice, but album version is at least equally good: especially the bassparts, simply epic", "Love this version! RAW!", "The guitar solo was performed by a studio musician who happen to be recording in a neighboring studio. He was a country and western guitarist on a break between sessions, met Bob in the hallway...the rest is awesome history.", "OK, now it's the great live recording from the \"Babylon By Bus\" album. Irie!", "Marley...........the one !!!!!", "This pre-Island era version is very dark and sad compared to the version on the Catch A Fire album. It's not as easy to accept but it's nice. I may still prefer the later version.", "que gran tema...me llena el corazon con sus vibras y su musica...grande bob", "the original Jamaican Version its waaaaayyy better than the album version!!", "OMG!!! I never heard this version of this song. I have at least 5 and I just never heard it mixed like this.
