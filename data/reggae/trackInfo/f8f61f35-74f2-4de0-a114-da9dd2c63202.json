It was originally recorded by Tina Turner as the B-side to the single &quot;Typical Male&quot; in 1986. Warren is said to have been disappointed that Turner's record company treated the song as a B-side and never included it on one of her albums.\n It has been covered by a number of artists. Kim Goody released a single version in 1987. Despite being featured in several episodes of her Saturday morning show No. 73, the song failed to get into the top 100 in the UK chart. Bonnie Tyler released her version on her 1988 album Notes from America, while soul singer Luther Ingram had a U.S. #55 R&amp;B hit with his interpretation. Aswad heard Ingram's version and made a cover of it, taking the song to #1 on the UK singles chart in March 1988. This version also reached #45 on the Billboard R&amp;B singles chart that same year.\n In 1990, a lesser known rock band Eyes, that reminds one of the &quot;hair band&quot; days, covered the song as well on their self titled album, under the Curb Records label. Although this album is out in the market, very little other information is out on the band.\n In 1992, Neil Diamond recorded a version of &quot;Don't Turn Around&quot;, which made the Top 20 on the Adult Contemporary chart. Two years later, in 1994, Swedish pop group Ace of Base took the song to #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and to #5 in the UK.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Don't Turn Around&quot; is a popular song written by Diane Warren and Albert Hammond.
