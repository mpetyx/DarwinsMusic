Since I live between LA and Long Beach, my mom and dad were told to go home that day, and when my dad was working that day he told me when he was delivering soda in Long Beach a group of blacks were looking at him probably thinking of stealing his product, and a store owner told him it's best if he got out of there.", "20 years since.
