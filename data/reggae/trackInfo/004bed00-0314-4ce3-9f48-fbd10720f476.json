One of Marley's best for sure. I can't believe it got taken out of the Catch a Fire release outside of Jamaica!!", "This truly one of the best.  It needs more listens.  The world would be a better place.", "good lord this is brilliant.", "Wow\u2026 no shouts for this masterpiece?!?!?!? Sure, this is a bit different from the rest of the material on the disc but that only makes it stand out even more as one of the most heartfelt tunes penned by Bob and the boys.
