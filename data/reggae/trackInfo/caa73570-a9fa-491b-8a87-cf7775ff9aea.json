The video utilizes extensive imagery from the Holocaust and Eastern European Jewish History, and the Civil Rights Movement, as well as using pictures to create a central composite of the Western Wall. This is the first of Matisyahu's videos which does not take place outdoors, and is the first which contains extensive symbolism rather than straightforward scenes.\n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Jerusalem&quot; is a song by Hasidic Jewish reggae singer Matisyahu, produced by Jimmy Douglass &amp; The Ill Factor, and first released in 2006 on his major label debut, Youth.
