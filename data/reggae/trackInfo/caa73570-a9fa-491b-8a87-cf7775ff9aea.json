A new version was recorded later in 2006 with Sly &amp; Robbie and was released as a digital single on September 19, 2006.[1]\n The song itself is based on Psalm 137, verses 5-7, one of the most well known of the Psalms:\n &quot;If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand wither, let my tongue cleave to my palate if I do not remember you, if I do not set Jerusalem above my highest joy.&quot;\n The psalm is said to have been written during the Babylonian Exile by Jeremiah expressing the desire of the Israelites to return to Jerusalem.\n Matisyahu used the chorus lyrics of Break My Stride by Matthew Wilder as the bridge in this single.\n \n On 31 September 2006, Matisyahu released a video for &quot;Jerusalem&quot;. The video utilizes extensive imagery from the Holocaust and Eastern European Jewish History, and the Civil Rights Movement, as well as using pictures to create a central composite of the Western Wall. This is the first of Matisyahu's videos which does not take place outdoors, and is the first which contains extensive symbolism rather than straightforward scenes.\n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Jerusalem&quot; is a song by Hasidic Jewish reggae singer Matisyahu, produced by Jimmy Douglass &amp; The Ill Factor, and first released in 2006 on his major label debut, Youth.
