R. Rahman</a>. Stone and Stewart had collaborated in the past with Jagger.\n \n The band's formation was announced on May 20, 2011. The <a href=\"http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=23376\" rel=\"nofollow\">Miracle Worker Songfacts</a> reports that the band's name came about after Damian Marley started riffing the term &quot;SuperHeavy,&quot; inspired by Muhammad Ali being the Super Heavyweight champion of the world, and the phrase became the band's catchphrase. &quot;It was Mick who said, 'Why don't we call it SuperHeavy?&quot;, recalled Stewart, &quot;We all thought about it for ages and then it sort of stuck.&quot;\n Jagger said of the band, &quot;We wanted a convergence of different musical styles... We were always overlapping styles, but they were nevertheless separate.&quot;\n \n What is SuperHeavy? <a href=\"http://www.superheavy.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.superheavy.com</a>\n Mick Jagger | Dave Stewart | Joss Stone | Damian \u201cJr Gong\u201d Marley | A.R. Rahman\n Mick Jagger has teamed up with Eurythmics founder Dave Stewart, soul singer Joss Stone, Academy Award winning composer and global superstar A.R.Rahman and reggae star Damian \u201cJr Gong\u201d Marley to form a cooperative project called SuperHeavy.\n \n This diverse and eclectic line up who share eleven Grammy Awards between them, have been recording together in various studios around the world, with the majority of the tracks on the project laid down over three weeks in Los Angeles earlier this year. Their self titled debut album will be unveiled in September and tracks include the first single \u2018Miracle Worker\u2019, plus \u2018One Day One Night\u2019, \u2018Energy\u2019, \u2018Unbelievable,\u2019 \u2018SuperHeavy,\u2019 I Can\u2019t Take It No More,\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re Never Gonna Change\u2019 and \u2018I Don\u2019t Mind.\u2019\n \n It\u2019s little wonder that Stewart refers to SuperHeavy as, \u201cA mad alchemist type experiment\u201c. Fusing the talents of one of the greatest front-men of all time, a two time Academy award winning Indian composer, a soul vocal prodigy, a three time Grammy winning reggae star, and one of the most sought after producers in the world, you would expect the explosive results to defy categorisation.\n \n Formation of the bandSuperHeavy came together after Jagger and Stewart considered what a band comprising of musicians from different genres would sound like. Jagger explains, \u201cDave really wanted to make a record with a different group of musicians, in other words, with different backgrounds of music. Instead of everyone being a rock musician, or basically a blues musician, or some other genre, he wanted to get as many genres together that would fit. I said it sounds like a good idea, I never thought it would actually happen.\u201d\n \n Yet soon enough Jagger found himself back in the studio with Stewart and Joss Stone, having previously worked together on the 2004 Alfie movie soundtrack. Stewart says Stone was, \u201can obvious choice for us. She\u2019s such an incredible singer and spirit.\u201d Stewart and Jagger\u2019s dream team took further shape when they were inspired to bring Damian \u201cJr Gong\u201d Marley into the mix, says Stewart, \u201cWe\u2019d always wanted a Jamaican musician because Mick and I are crazy about Jamaica and Jamaican music.\u201d Stewart has worked with legend Jimmy Cliff while Mick has duetted with Peter Tosh from the Wailers on the Tempatations tune \u201cDon\u2019t Look Back\u201d in 1978.\n \n \u201cWe were listening to loads of stuff and suddenly a light bulb went off and we thought about Damian \u201cJr Gong\u201d Marley.\u201d Jagger had long been a fan of Marley\u2019s, fresh from another cross-genre collaboration with American rapper Nas, citing his strength as a lyricist and toaster along with his penchant for experimentation and collaborative spirit. Marley brought on board his rhythm section, bassist and composer Shiah Coore and drummer Courtney Diedrick, while Stewart introduced the band to his long-term collaborator Ann Marie Calhoun, a rock violinist who had previously worked with the Foo Fighters.\n \n Recording in LA meant the band\u2019s path crossed with legendary Indian composer A.R. Rahman, in the City of Angels fresh from his Slumdog Millionaire Oscar glory. Jagger explains, \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what kind of music we\u2019d make, we didn\u2019t know if it would be any good, but we hoped we\u2019d have fun.\u201d They were thrilled to have Rahman on board, Stewart says, \u201cHe brings so much musical knowledge, amazing musicianship, melody and singing power from a different culture.\u201d\n \n The creative process beginsDespite their disparate backgrounds, the members of SuperHeavy instantly connected and hit the ground running, writing twenty-two songs in the first six days. Stone was thrilled with the results, \u201cThat\u2019s what you need, all these opinionated people who have been brilliant in their own field, shove them together and see what comes out. It\u2019s really unexpected, its mind blowing\u201d she enthuses. Similarly enthused was Rahman, \u201cThe first day I was in a daze thinking, \u2018What am I doing? What\u2019s my role?\u2019 and then slowly we started writing with each other, and it was great. It took me way back to my high school days when I was playing in a rock band, but this one was a real one!\u201d Jagger says of the writing process, \u201cWe ran the gamut of all our different styles mixed up, so we got Joss singing, Damian doing toasting, and me singing different styles.\u201c\n \n However, despite the free flow of creative juices and the easy rapport they established, getting the band together in one place became very difficult, as Stewart explains, \u201cIt\u2019s the most complicated record ever made. Imagine, some of it\u2019s recorded in LA, some of it\u2019s recorded in the South of France, some of it\u2019s recorded off the coast of Cyprus, some of it\u2019s recorded in Turkey, some of it\u2019s recorded in Miami, some of it\u2019s recorded in the Caribbean, and some of it\u2019s recorded in Chennai, in India.\u201d\n \n The project needed a name. Marley had been riffing the term \u201cSuperHeavy\u201d, inspired by Muhammad Ali being the super heavyweight champion of the world and the phrase became the band\u2019s catchphrase, \u201cIt was Mick who said, \u2018Why don\u2019t we call it SuperHeavy?\u201d, recalls Stewart, \u201cWe all thought about it for ages and then it sort of stuck.\u201d\n \n SuperHeavy is a new and spontaneous way of working for all the collaborators as Jagger explains, \u201cI said to Dave, normally [with the Stones] we\u2019d always have written songs before we go into the studio,\u201d but the jam sessions resulted in some great work. Stone explains, \u201cIt felt better when we were just jamming, that way we made it up as we went along and it was easy.\u201d\n \n The band found a harmonious way of working together, \u201cWith five of you everyone has to give and take quite a lot. We tried to understand everyone wouldn\u2019t be too egotistical, start throwing things around the studio, we wouldn\u2019t have fights!\u201d says Jagger. However they weren\u2019t averse to telling each other to be better either, Jagger continues, \u201cWe were writing a lot of stuff and throwing it away. I would say, \u2018That\u2019s rubbish, another clich\u00e9 Joss\u2019, and she\u2019d say, \u2018Well you come up with something then!\u201d The experience was refreshing and exciting for the band, \u201cWe\u2019re four vocalists and we\u2019ve never worked like that before. It\u2019s great because the whole burdens not on you, and that made it fun.\u201d Jagger enthuses.\n \n The SuperHeavy soundBack to that alchemical experiment, Jagger, Stewart, Marley, Rahman and Stone appear to have created a new genre. \u201cIt\u2019s a new kind of music, it\u2019s a new genre, one that cannot be placed\u201d says Stone. Yet, Jagger is keen to point out the music is accessible; \u201cIt\u2019s very approachable. If you\u2019re a Rolling Stones fan there\u2019s definitely stuff you can relate to. Other stuff that you can\u2019t relate to so much, maybe if you listen you\u2019ll enjoy it.\u201d\n \n A first for Mick Jagger is singing in Urdu, on a song composed by Rahman, entitled \u201cSatyameva Jayate\u201d, meaning, \u201cthe truth alone triumphs\u201d, Rahman wrote the song after some gentle teasing from the others. Rahman explains, \u201cIn the daytime I was playing with them, in the night time and evenings I was gigging\u201d \u201cThen\u201d, says Jagger, \u201cHe didn\u2019t come into the studio one day, so I said, \u2018Where\u2019s A.R?\u2019 and he came in really late at night, really pleased saying, \u2018I\u2019ve got my song!\u2019 I manage one line in Urdu, only one!\u201c\n \n Marley\u2019s way of working was different to the rest of the band. Stone reveals, \u201cDamian is kind of quiet but he has some brilliant ideas. He works on stuff at night. Sometimes he\u2019ll just go away and sit with the lyrics and bring something to it. His rhythm section brings so much. He has his own thing going in the next room so I pop in and out.\u201d Marley would work on toasting over the record by himself and re-join the band when he was happy with it.\n \n The art of SuperHeavyThe striking artwork that graces the front of the SuperHeavy album is the work of Shepard Fairey, the artist responsible for the iconic \u2018Hope\u2019 poster used in Barack Obama\u2019s successful election campaign.\n \n An introduction to the band members\n Mick Jagger\n \n Mick Jagger is rock\u2019s premier frontman and one of the most popular and influential British musicians of all time. Instantly recognizable as the iconic lead singer with the Rolling Stones, the greatest rock\u2019n'roll band in the world, he has set standards for performance and creativity that remain unmatched to this day.\n \n Dave Stewart\n \n Dave Stewart\u2019s music career spans three decades and more than 100 million album sales, highlighted by his collaboration with Annie Lennox in the groundbreaking pop-rock group The Eurythmics (\u201cSweet Dreams [Are Made of This]\u201c, \u201cWould I Lie to You?\u201d and dozens more).\n \n Behind the scenes, he\u2019s produced albums and co-written songs for Stevie Nicks, Tom Petty, Bono, Sinead O\u2019Connor, Mick Jagger, Katy Perry, Jon Bon Jovi and a host of others, racking up numerous Producer, Songwriter and Grammy Awards along the way.\n \n \n Joss Stone\n \n Joss Stone has been obsessed with soul music since she was a little girl. By the time she was in her early teens she had begun to intuitively hone her now trademark gravely-but-lustrous vocals by singing along to Aretha\u2019s Franklin\u2019s Greatest Hits.\n \n She began pursuing a singing career at thirteen, when she auditioned for UK talent show Star For a Night. This eventually led to a record deal and the release of Stone\u2019s star- making debut album, \u2018The Soul Sessions\u2019, in 2003. Her second record, 2004\u2032s \u2018Mind Body &amp; Soul\u2019 earned Stone three Grammy nominations and was followed by 2007\u2032s \u2018Introducing Joss Stone\u2019 which achieved the highest debut billboard chart position for a female British solo artist.\n \n \n Damian \u201cJr Gong\u201d Marley\n \n Though his debut album was released in 1996, Damian \u201cJr Gong\u201d Marley had been honing his skills as a singer, MC, songwriter, lyricist and producer since long before then, performing both with a group and as a solo artist from the age of 13.\n \n His breakthrough album \u2018Halfway Tree\u2019 won Marley his first Grammy in 2002. This was followed in 2005 by \u2018Welcome to Jamrock\u2019 which received two more Grammys and featured the massive single of the same name.\n \n In 2010 Marley released \u2018Distant Relatives\u2019, a collaborative album with the American Rapper Nas which confronted the plight of the people of Africa.\n \n \n A. R. Rahman\n \n A two-time winner of the Academy Award (Oscar), A. R. Rahman is popularly known as the man who has redefined contemporary Indian music.\n \n Hailed by Time magazine as the \u2018Mozart of Madras\u2019, Rahman, according to a BBC estimate, has sold more than 150 million copies of his work comprising of music from more than 100 film soundtracks and albums across over half a dozen languages, including landmark scores such as \u2018Roja\u2019, \u2018Bombay\u2019, Dil Se\u2019, \u2018Taal\u2019, \u2018Lagaan\u2019, \u2018Vandemataram\u2019 and more recently, \u2018Jodhaa Akbar\u2019, \u2018Delhi 6\u2032 and \u2018Slumdog Millionaire\u2019.\n \n \n The present and future of SuperHeavyThe astonishing video for \u2018Miracle Worker\u2019 was filmed at Paramount studios in Los Angeles and directed by Paul Boyd and Dave Stewart. All five members of the band are featured in the video which culminates with a breathtaking live performance. Click here to watch the video for Miracle Worker on YouTube.\n \n As far as the future of SuperHeavy goes, \u201cWe haven\u2019t planned to do a tour or anything, but if people really like it maybe we will. We\u2019d love to get out and play some of it live,\u201d says Jagger humbly. \u201cAs soon as we started playing together in the studio it gelled, and all these different styles didn\u2019t seem to be a problem to make them fit together\u2026 I hope people will like it\u2026.\u201c\n \n SuperHeavy\u2019s debut album is co-produced by Jagger &amp; Stewart and will be released by Universal Music on their A&amp;M label imprint on the 19th of September.\n \n Website :<a href=\"http://www.superheavy.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.superheavy.com</a>\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "<a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/SuperHeavy\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">SuperHeavy</a> is a <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/rock\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">rock</a> supergroup consisting of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mick+Jagger\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Mick Jagger</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Stewart\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Dave Stewart</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Joss+Stone\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Joss Stone</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Damian+Marley\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Damian Marley</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/A.+R.+Rahman\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">A.
