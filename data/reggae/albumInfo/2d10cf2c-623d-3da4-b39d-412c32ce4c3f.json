{"album": {"wiki": {"content": "<strong>Natty Dread</strong> is a 1974 reggae album by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Marley+&amp;+The+Wailers\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers</a>.\n \n An important transition in Marley's discography, Natty Dread was the first album released as Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers (as opposed to <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Wailers\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Wailers</a>) and the first recorded without former bandmates <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Peter+Tosh\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Peter Tosh</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bunny+Wailer\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Bunny Wailer</a>. It is also the first album recorded with the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/I-Threes\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">I-Threes</a>, a female vocal trio that included Bob's wife, Rita Marley, along with Marcia Griffiths and Judy Mowatt.\n \n Natty Dread is a spiritually charged political and social statement. It opens with a <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/blues\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">blues</a>-influenced positive celebration of skanking, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/reggae\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">reggae</a> and sex, <a title=\"Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers &ndash; Lively Up Yourself\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Marley+&amp;+The+Wailers/_/Lively+Up+Yourself\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Lively Up Yourself</a>, which Marley used to open many of his concerts, in order to get the audience worked up; American R&amp;B star <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Prince\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Prince</a> used it for the same purpose. <a title=\"Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers &ndash; No Woman No Cry\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Bob+Marley+&amp;+The+Wailers/_/No+Woman+No+Cry\" class=\"bbcode_track\">No Woman No Cry</a>, the second track, is probably the best known recording on the album. It is a nostalgic remembrance of growing up in the impoverished streets of Trenchtown, and the happiness brought by the company of friends. The song has been performed by artists as diverse as <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Boney+M.\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Boney M.</a> (sung by Liz Mitchell), <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Fugees\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Fugees</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pearl+Jam\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Pearl Jam</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jimmy+Buffett\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Jimmy Buffett</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Rancid\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Rancid</a>. Songwriting credit for &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot; went to V. Ford. Ford, better known as Tartar to his friends and neighbors, had been a kind friend of Marley as a child in Trench Town, the ghetto of Kingston, Jamaica. Marley claimed he would have starved to death on several occasions as a child if not for the aid of Tartar.\n \n <a title=\"Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers &ndash; Them Belly Full (But We Hungry)\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Marley+&amp;+The+Wailers/_/Them+Belly+Full+(But+We+Hungry)\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Them Belly Full (But We Hungry)</a> is a warning against allowing a nation's poor to go hungry, with the prophetic warning &quot;a hungry mob is an angry mob&quot; (the song is reportedly dedicated to newly-elected Democratic Socialist Michael Manley), while <a title=\"Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers &ndash; Talkin' Blues\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Marley+&amp;+The+Wailers/_/Talkin%27+Blues\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Talkin' Blues</a> and <a title=\"Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers &ndash; Revolution\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Marley+&amp;+The+Wailers/_/Revolution\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Revolution</a> go deeper into controversial political commentary. <a title=\"Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers &ndash; Rebel Music (3 O'Clock Roadblock)\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Marley+&amp;+The+Wailers/_/Rebel+Music+(3+O%27Clock+Roadblock)\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Rebel Music (3 O'Clock Roadblock)</a> is a reflection on the potential impact of reggae music on Jamaican society. The song was written after Marley had been stopped by a night-time police carcheck. The influence of Marley's increasing devotion to Rastafari can be heard in religious-themed songs like <a title=\"Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers &ndash; So Jah S'eh\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Marley+&amp;+The+Wailers/_/So+Jah+S%27eh\" class=\"bbcode_track\">So Jah S'eh</a>, <a title=\"Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers &ndash; Natty Dread\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Marley+&amp;+The+Wailers/_/Natty+Dread\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Natty Dread</a> and &quot;Lively Up Yourself&quot;, while Marley's reputation as a romantic is confirmed with smooth, seductive songs like <a title=\"Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers &ndash; Bend Down Low\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Marley+&amp;+The+Wailers/_/Bend+Down+Low\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Bend Down Low</a>. The title track of the album takes its title from an idealised personification of the Rastafari movement, Natty Dread.\n \n Jazz Guitarist <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Hunter\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Charlie Hunter</a> covered the entire album on his 1997 release of the same name. In 1975, this album was mentioned in a few audio magazines as being ready to be released on Quadraphonic 8-track tape. This unfortunately never happened. However, the Quadraphonic mixes of &quot;Lively Up Yourself&quot; and &quot;No Woman No Cry&quot; have been bootlegged from the master tapes and are available on the internet. In 2001, a re-mastered edition of Natty Dread was released by Universal Records containing a bonus track. In 2003, the album was ranked number 182 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n \n <strong><em>Song writing credits</em></strong>\n Although the album's liner notes list multiple songwriters, including family friends and bandmembers, all songs were written by Marley. Marley was involved in a contractual dispute with his former publishing company, Cayman music.\n \n Vincent Ford, a childhood friend from Jamacia, was given writing credit for &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot; on the 1974 album Natty Dread, as well the songs <a title=\"Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers &ndash; Crazy Baldheads\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Marley+&amp;+The+Wailers/_/Crazy+Baldheads\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Crazy Baldheads</a> (with Marley's wife Rita), <a title=\"Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers &ndash; Positive Vibration\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Marley+&amp;+The+Wailers/_/Positive+Vibration\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Positive Vibration</a> and <a title=\"Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers &ndash; Roots, Rock, Reggae\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Marley+&amp;+The+Wailers/_/Roots,+Rock,+Reggae\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Roots, Rock, Reggae</a> from the 1976 album <a title=\"Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers - Rastaman Vibration\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Marley+&amp;+The+Wailers/Rastaman+Vibration\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Rastaman Vibration</a>, along with <span title=\"Unknown track\" class=\"bbcode_unknown\">Inna De Red</span> and <span title=\"Unknown track\" class=\"bbcode_unknown\">Jah Bless</span> with Marley's son, <a class=\"music artist\">Stephen</a>.\n \n Marley had not wanted his new songs to be associated with Cayman and it had been speculated, including in his obituary in The Independent, that he had put them in the names of his close friends and family members as a means of avoiding the contractual restrictions and as a way to &quot;provide lasting help to family and close friends&quot;.\n \n Marley's widow and his former manager Danny Sims sued to obtain royalty and ownership rights to the songs, claiming that Marley had actually written the songs but had assigned the credit to Ford to avoid meeting commitments made in prior contracts. A 1987 court decision sided with the Marley estate, which assumed full control of the songs.\n \n Natty Dread peaked at #44 on Billboard's (North America) Black Albums chart, and at #92 on the Pop Albums chart.\n \n The first CD issue of Natty Dread featured track mixes that differed on some tracks from those on the original 1974 vinyl release.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Natty Dread is a 1974 reggae album by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Marley+&amp;+The+Wailers\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers</a>.
