{"album": {"wiki": {"content": "Infinite is Eminem's first full-length and professionally packaged album. After years of cutting demo tracks with his mentors, the Bass Brothers, at their Ferndale, Michigan studio (dubbed &quot;The Bassmint&quot;), Eminem was ready to release his debut album. The album was written and recorded in 1995. At the time the album was first conceived, Eminem had been using the stage name M&amp;M. However, he changed his stage name after the release of his first official single, in early 1995. Infinite marks the debut of the name &quot;Eminem&quot;. The album was only released on cassette and vinyl, and was originally sold through Mathers himself. Only 1,000 cassettes and 100 vinyl records were made. Eminem himself, and old friends from around the time Infinite was recorded, have claimed the laid-back and humble nature of the album is due to Eminem purposely making &quot;radio-friendly&quot; songs in hopes of getting on the air of Detroit's leading Hip Hop radio station, WJLB. Bootlegged compact-disc copies are commonly found on sites such as eBay. The song &quot;Backstabber&quot; is a re-cut version of a song called &quot;Fuckin' Backstabber&quot;, which is featured on a demo tape by Soul Intent.\n While it contains some swearing, Infinite is relatively inoffensive compared to the subsequent albums that would make Eminem famous.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Infinite is Eminem's first full-length and professionally packaged album.
