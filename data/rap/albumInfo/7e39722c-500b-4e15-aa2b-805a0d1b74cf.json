Although the album was originally released on Jive Records, Priority Records, (Prioirty distributed Interscope's early releases in conjunction with Atlantic Records), Interscope, Amaru Entertainment, the label owned by the mother of Tupac Shakur, has since gained the rights to it. The album's name is a reference to the 1979 film Apocalypse Now. It was produced in Rearcross. The album generated significant controversy stemming from Dan Quayle's public criticism after a youth in Texas shot a state trooper and his defense attorney claimed he was influenced by 2Pacalypse Now and its strong theme of police brutality. Quayle made the statement, &quot;There's no reason for a record like this to be released. It has no place in our society.&quot;\n \n The record never achieved the same success as many of Shakur's later albums owing in part to rough construction and sometimes repetitive beats, but it was important in showcasing Shakur's political conviction and lyrical talent. It went on to be certified Gold by the RIAA. It featured three singles, &quot;Brenda's Got a Baby&quot;, &quot;Trapped&quot;, and &quot;If My Homie Calls&quot;.\n \n 2Pacalypse Now can be found in the Vinyl Countdown and in the instruction manual for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas along with the track &quot;I Don't Give a Fuck&quot; which appeared on the in-game radio station, Radio Los Santos.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "2Pacalypse Now is the debut album by rapper 2Pac, released in November 1991.
