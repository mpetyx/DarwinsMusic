He also notes that he will no longer use the accent in the future right after saying how his last album, Relapse, wasn't as good compared to his previous albums. He promises he will never leave again and now only has his daughters and his music to focus on.&quot;\n \n The song was featured on 24/7, showcasing the preparations of the Floyd Mayweather vs. Shane Mosley fight.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Not Afraid&quot; is the first single from American rapper Eminem's seventh studio album Recovery.
