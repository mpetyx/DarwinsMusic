The song was released as a single in 1993.\n \n The single failed to match the popularity of Dre's earlier hit, &quot;Nuthin' but a &quot;G&quot; Thang&quot;, although it did reach number eight on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart in June 1993 and number six (counting the twelve weeks spent) on the rap/hip-hop chart on that year's overall ranking. The song features a slowed-down interpolation of Funkadelic's &quot;(Not Just) Knee Deep&quot; as its bassline and features Jewell on vocals and RBX on chorus.\n \n The song was a diss towards rappers Eazy-E, Dre's former accomplice; Tim Dog, an East Coast rapper who slighted the whole West Coast rap scene; and Luther (Luke) Campbell, whose track &quot;Fakin' Like Gangstas&quot; from his debut solo album I Got Shit On My Mind (featuring JT Money from the group Poison Clan) was taken personally for making references to some of the popular rappers in the &quot;gangsta&quot; category. Snoop Dogg later made peace between him and Luke in the song Hoez from Smokefest Underground. &quot;Fuck Wit' Dre Day&quot; has an accompanying music video directed by Dr. Dre.\n Eazy-E retaliated on his next album It's On (Dr. Dre) 187um Killa which contained the song &quot;Real Muthaphuckkin G's&quot;, on which he makes fun of Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg (calling them &quot;studio gangstas&quot;), and Death Row Records.\n \n Tim Dog responded with &quot;Dog Baby&quot; and &quot;Bitch with a Perm&quot; \u2014 two tracks directed at Snoop Dogg. Tim Dog was angry at Snoop for his 2nd verse and line &quot;Tim Dog can eat a big fat dick&quot; at the end of the song, as well as the representation of the lines &quot;Fuck me in the ass!&quot; and &quot;Step to me and let me suck your dick!&quot; as &quot;things that Tim Dog would say&quot; in the skit track, &quot;The $20 Sack Pyramid&quot;.\n \n Luther Campbell along with JT Money and then-upcoming artist Clayvoisie responded with the song &quot;Cowards in Compton&quot; (from Luke's second solo LP, In The Nude) and its accompanying video that parodied Dre's original premise as a member of the mid-1980s rap group World Class Wreckin' Cru. On which Tweedy Bird Loc dissed Luther on &quot;Fucc Miami&quot; including &quot;Tha Shiznit&quot; where Snoop retaliated.\n \n &quot;Fuck Wit' Dre Day&quot; was included as a single for the video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, playing on West Coast hip hop radio station Radio Los Santos.\n \n Snoop Dogg used and originated the word &quot;bootylicious&quot; in this song almost a decade before the 2001 single of that name by Destiny's Child. However, in this song it means &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;weak&quot;; that is far different from the meaning Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles gave it in her group's hit, which the Oxford English Dictionary Online used when it added &quot;bootylicious&quot; in 2004.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Fuck wit Dre Day (And Everybody's Celebratin')&quot; (released as &quot;Dre Day&quot;) is a hip-hop single by Dr. Dre, with a guest appearance by Snoop Doggy Dogg, from the 1992 album The Chronic on Death Row Records.
