We\u2019d make the beats in Hav\u2019s crib [but lay vocals in the studio]. Or sometimes, we\u2019d make the beat in the crib, write half of the song in the crib, then go to the studio and finish it. That was one of the ones where Hav ain\u2019t really like the beat. He was about to erase that shit. There\u2019s a lot of joints like that, where he was about to trash them and we had to change his mind. I was out somewhere on the block chilling probably, I came in the crib, and Hav had the beat playing. \n \n \u201cI was like, \u2018Damn. What the fuck is this?\u2019 He\u2019s like, \u2018It\u2019s some bullshit, I\u2019m about to fucking scratch this shit and do another one.\u2019 I was like \u2018Nah, don\u2019t scratch that nigga, hold up. Let niggas hear this.\u2019 And I called niggas over like, \u2018Yo, listen to this fucking beat this nigga just made.\u2019 And everybody was like, \u2018Yo, that shit is crazy.\u2019 Then we both just started writing rhymes to it and it came out good. We knocked that out all in one day. So, I had to save that one. \n \n \u201cHav\u2019s pops was a DJ, so Hav had a lot of records from the \u201870s and the \u201880s. We both had a good record collection. Hav was already listening to records before I met him. He was trying to sample on a cassette player, hit record, pause, record, and pause, and making the beats like that. When he met me, we bought the equipment. That\u2019s when he started to really get into making beats. I actually showed him how to sample, how to do this, and how to sequence the shit. Once he got the hang of it he just went in and started going crazy.&quot;\n \n Havoc: \u201cI was just making beats in my crib in the projects. We had already put out \u2018Shook Ones\u2019 and our confidence was up. At that time, I was into sampling a lot of jazz records so I found this loop. I put it together. I tried to make it sound as crispy as I could when we were in the studio recording it. \n \n \u201cI remember my cousin Ferg being in the studio. He was from Brooklyn, he was running the streets wild, and he was like 16 at the time, so I said, \u2018Yo, go in the booth and just go ad-lib behind the chorus.\u2019 And he was just like, \u2018Yeah, thug life we still living it.\u2019 And this is way before Tupac [started saying \u2018Thug Life\u2019] and I don\u2019t know if he felt like he came with that first. But this is from the heart, when we did that we didn\u2019t know nothing about no Tupac. My little cousin went back there [and did the hook] and the shit was dope. He wasn\u2019t an actual rapper at that time. I know he used to write his little rhymes, but that\u2019s not actually why I put him in the booth\u2014I put him in there to get that raw, unbiased energy. \n \n \u201c[I rhymed about Timbs and army certified suits because] that was our thing. We were just straight hood. It wasn\u2019t no pretty boy shit. It was like, \u2018Yo, let\u2019s throw on our Timbs.\u2019 It didn\u2019t get more harder than that. We weren\u2019t the kind of muthafuckas that was in the mirror for like a half an hour, nah. Nine times out of ten, we wearing the same pants for the week. We had our Timbs with our 40s on the block. It wasn\u2019t a gimmick. That\u2019s what we was wearing.\u201d \n \n Matty C a.k.a. Matt Life (Executive Producer and A&amp;R for Loud Records): \u201cThe original version of \u2018Survival of the Fittest\u2019 had James Brown going \u2018Gotta get over before we get under!\u2019 during the chorus and that had to come out. What the publishers wanted for that little sample wasn\u2019t worth it. That was my first time dealing with those issues and helping the group make those calls about what was worth keeping.\u201d\n \n Schott Free (Executive Producer and A&amp;R for Loud Records):\u201cI remember leaving the office and going to the studio with Havoc. He was smoking a thousand cigarettes while chopping away at something and he had had the drums up for a minute. I remember he caught that one piano piece lovely. The whole crew was like, \u2018Oooo.\u2019 He came with the rhyme and format and everything like that. \n \n \u201cThen Tip gets a hold of it. Tip leaves the loop just like it is\u2014the same way that Havoc caught it\u2014but then just infiltrates it entirely on the drum situation. It intensifies the entire record. If you ever hear the original, it\u2019s ill, it\u2019s gloomy, it\u2019s street, but it\u2019s nowhere as huge as Tip made it when he just changed up the drums. He just implemented that over the loop that Hav had and then just added so much on top of it.&quot;\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Prodigy: \u201cWe made that in Hav\u2019s crib, in Queensbridge.
