Pac the greatest.", "LGS, you may be retarded; he left Death Row and the Illuminati-assisted evil influence of Suge Knight to start Amaru as a separate imprint with his \"Don Killuminati\" persona.  His last album he dropped when he was alive was all about the Law of 7, karma, martyrdom, prophecy, and what's really good with hip-hop.  Suge Knight was one of the most powerful executives in hip-hop back then but Pac spoke to the people and he wasn't gonna keep selling his soul to the occultic brainwashing syndicates.  You've gotta be huffing paint thinner if you think he would've allowed himself to be relegated to a \"bubblegum rapper\", LOLSMH.", "@wyteboy. I doubt it verrrrrrry much that he would have 'regulated' shit. Do you remember the man who used to 'own' him? I'd bet you all the money in the world he'd be a bubblegum rapper for Death Row today if he were still alive.", "yes, and its worse", "Get straight stoned and blast this", "smokin' weed and gettin' blazed up", "So many great tracks on \"AEoM\", but this is one of the deepest, IMO . . . the lyrics are solid but the beat is just so tight, too!", "pac is dead man juss face it dogg ive studied and studied if he was alive he would have been came back and regulated shit im a huge tupac fan dogg and i wish he wasnt dead but he is.....
