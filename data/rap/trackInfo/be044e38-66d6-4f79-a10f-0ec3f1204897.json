I was at the top of the rap game. It was the summer of \u201992 and I was in a hotel room, really in a state of euphoria. I had all the money I had dreamed of. I was in a good frame of mind. And I remember thinking, \u2018Okay, there\u2019s been the riots, people know I will deal with that. That\u2019s a given. But I rap all this gangsta stuff \u2014 what about all the good days I had?&quot;\n \n The song samples <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Isley+Brothers\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Isley Brothers</a>\u2019 \u201c<a title=\"The Isley Brothers &ndash; Footsteps In The Dark\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Isley+Brothers/_/Footsteps+In+The+Dark\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Footsteps In The Dark</a> &quot;, and DJ Pooh enhanced the production with bass and vocals.
