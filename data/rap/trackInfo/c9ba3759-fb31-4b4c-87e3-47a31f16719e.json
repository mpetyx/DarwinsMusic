The song is based around piano chords. In the song, Tyler talks about how he has no real relationship with his father, hates school, can't deal with his unrequited love, and wants to kill himself (or his father first). The song itself is 5 Minutes and 58 seconds, but the original version contains an intro where Tyler defends Odd Future from the media. It opens with Tyler's therapist trying to talk to Tyler, but Tyler being reluctant at first before he goes into a fluster about his emotions.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "The album begins with the title track, &quot;Bastard&quot;.
