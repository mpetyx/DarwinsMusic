Cameron for 50 Cent's commercial debut album Get Rich or Die Tryin' (2003). Released in 2003 as the album's second single, it became his second number one song in the United States after &quot;In Da Club&quot;. It reached number six in the UK Singles Chart while &quot;In Da Club&quot; was at #23, giving him the rare feat of having two singles in the Top 30 at the same time. The track was produced by Dirty Swift and Bruce Waynne of Midi Mafia and samples Barry White's &quot;It's Only Love Doing Its Thing&quot;. R&amp;B singer Lil' Mo created the answer-back remix titled &quot;21 Answers&quot;. Her version received decent airplay, and was often merged together with 50 Cent's version for club play.\n \n When producer Dr. Dre worked with 50 Cent on his debut album, he stated that he did not want the song on the album. According to 50 Cent, &quot;Dre was, like, 'How you goin' to be gangsta this and that and then put this sappy love song on?'&quot;[1] 50 Cent responded saying, &quot;I'm two people. I've always had to be two people since I was a kid, to get by. To me that's not diversity, it's necessity.&quot;\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;21 Questions&quot; is a song performed by rapper 50 Cent.
