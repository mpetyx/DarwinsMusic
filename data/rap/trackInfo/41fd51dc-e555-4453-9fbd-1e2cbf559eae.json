It was included on the soundtrack of the 1987 film Less Than Zero and was also released as a single that year. It later became the second track (and the first actual song) on the group's groundbreaking 1988 album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back. The single reached #56 on the Billboard Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.\n \n The song's lyrics, most of which are delivered rapid-fire by Chuck D with interjections from Flavor Flav, include boasts of Public Enemy's prowess, an endorsement of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, retorts to unspecified critics, and arguments for rap as a legitimate musical genre on par with rock. The lyrics also have a remarkable metrical complexity, making extensive use of meters like dactylic hexameter. The title phrase appears in the chorus. The song includes several shout-outs to artists like Run-DMC, Eric B, LL Cool J and, unusual for a rap group, thrash metal band Anthrax, allegedly because Chuck D was flattered about Scott Ian wearing Public Enemy shirts while performing Anthrax gigs.\n \n The song's production by The Bomb Squad, which exemplifies their characteristic style, features a dissonant mixture of funk samples, drum machine patterns, record scratching by DJ Terminator X, siren sound effects and other industrial noise.\n \n &quot;Bring the Noise&quot; was ranked #160 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest songs of all time.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Bring the Noise&quot; is a song by the hip hop group Public Enemy.
