It tells the story of his attempts to calm a violent community of rappers. He speaks openly about problems with The Source magazine and its editor Benzino, as well as Murder Inc. Records, and explains the feud between Ja Rule and 50 Cent, which Eminem felt went way beyond the Jay-Z vs. Nas feud. The song finishes as Eminem offers a truce to his enemies.

This word is believed to be &quot;Suge&quot;, a reference to Suge Knight with whom Dr. Dre had problems in the mid 90's.\n &quot;Like Toy Soldiers&quot; was included on Eminem's compilation album Curtain Call: The Hits in 2005.\n In addition, this song also brings up some issues with his ongoing feud with Ja Rule who made some remarks about Hailie, Marshall's daughter, on a song called &quot;Loose Change&quot;. Ja Rule called Eminem's wife 'a known slut' and his mother a crackhead in the song and wondered what Eminem's 12 year old daughter Hailie was going to be &quot;when she grows up&quot;.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Like Toy Soldiers&quot; is a song by American rapper Eminem from the album Encore.
