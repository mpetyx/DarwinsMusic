The song &quot;Crossroad&quot; was originally dedicated to Bone's deceased friends, but after the death of Eazy-E they decided to remake it as &quot;Tha Crossroads&quot;. The song is performed by four of the group's members, (Krayzie Bone, Layzie Bone, Bizzy Bone and Wish Bone), but a remix can be found which includes later addition Flesh-n-Bone. The remake contained the line &quot;And I'm askin' the good Lord &quot;Why?&quot; and sigh, he told me we lived to die&quot; from the original. Bone's lightning fast rhymes are delivered softer than is usual for the group, without profanities and creating a sad and heartfelt effect. With soft instrumentals revolving around a sample of The Isley Brothers' &quot;Make Me Say It Again Girl (Pts. 1 and 2),&quot; the song has a sad yet quick tone to it. After receiving high praise for their song the group decided to add it to their already launched album, E 1999 Eternal. The single rose to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for 8 weeks, sold over two million copies, and would later win a Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group at the 39th Annual Grammy Awards. &quot;Tha Crossroads&quot; is also known to be in the best selling rap songs of all-time. &quot;Tha Crossroads&quot; won Bone Thugs-N-Harmony a grammy for best rap song in 1997, topped #1 in the billboard pop charts for 9 weeks, and broke The Beatles' 32 year-old record for fastest-rising single[citation needed].\n \n The song was certified 2x Platinum by the RIAA, and later appeared on the soundtrack to the 2008 film &quot;Pineapple Express&quot;.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Originally named &quot;Crossroad,&quot; it wasn't until the group and their producer, DJ U-Neek, decided to remake the song that the name was changed.
