It was released as an EP, entitled An Exciting Evening at Home with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. Released on October 30, 1989, it was the second and last single released from the album.\n \n The song refers to the Biblical story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and the fiery furnace in the Book of Daniel. However, the lyrics &quot;Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego&quot; were also present in Robert MacGimsey's 1931 original as well as in Sly Stone's &quot;Loose Booty&quot;, where they are repeated and spoken rhythmically throughout the track in an almost rap-like form. In verse two, the lyric, So I'm out pickin' pockets at the Atlantic Antic, refers to an annual Brooklyn street festival of that name. Also in the song is reference to the AC/DC album For Those About to Rock, in the lyrics &quot;For those about to rock we salute you&quot;\n \n The video released to promote the Beastie Boys' song is particularly acclaimed for its style and artistic beauty, as each frame was painted by hand. The 12&quot; record and CD versions of the single are on a six-song EP entitled An Exciting Evening at Home with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. The video can be seen on the Beastie Boys Criterion Collection DVD set.\n Samples:\n     * &quot;Say What&quot; by Trouble Funk\n     * &quot;That's the Joint&quot; by Funky 4+1\n     * &quot;Do Your Dance&quot; by Rose Royce\n     * &quot;Never Let 'Em Say&quot; by Ballin' Jack\n     * &quot;Funky Drummer&quot; by James Brown\n     * &quot;Hot and Nasty&quot; by Black Oak Arkansas\n     * &quot;Sugarhill Groove&quot; by the Sugarhill Gang\n     * &quot;Loose Booty&quot; by Sly &amp; the Family Stone\n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Shadrach&quot; is a song by rap trio Beastie Boys from their album Paul's Boutique.
