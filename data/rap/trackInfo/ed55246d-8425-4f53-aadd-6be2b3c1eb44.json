Its title is often incorrectly assumed to be &quot;Ridin' Dirty&quot; due to the chorus. The lyrics concern racial profiling and police brutality, as well as the stereotyping of African Americans driving a vehicle with drugs or other contraband on the inside (&quot;riding dirty&quot;). The music video attempts to create a sense of the police abusing their powers despite the singer admitting to various crimes including driving under the influence, juxtaposing police actions with wrestling scenes to show how the police allegedly treat suspects. The music video, filmed in Dallas, Texas, also has cameo appearances by Tom Lister Jr., Wish Bone, Layzie Bone, Play-N-Skillz, Chingo Bling, OG Ron C, Big Tuck, and Chamillionaire's younger brother Rasaq.\n \n Ridin' was awarded &quot;Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group&quot; at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards.
