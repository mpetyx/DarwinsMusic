It reached number one in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, and New Zealand. This song is one of the few to debut at #1 in the U.S. on the Billboard Hot 100, and the only rap song to do so until Eminem's &quot;Not Afraid&quot; debuted at the top spot 13 years later in 2010. The song spent a record breaking 11 weeks at #1 on the Hot 100, making it the longest running #1 hip-hop song in history until Eminem's &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; spent 12 weeks at #1 in 2002. The song re-entered the UK Singles Chart at #32 on July 8, 2007, ten years after it had its full physical release and 10 years after it was #1.\n \n Blender magazine ranked the song at #25 on its list of the &quot;50 Worst Songs Ever&quot;, calling it &quot;a nauseating brew of gloopy sentimentality and strategic-marketing mawkishness.&quot;\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;I'll Be Missing You&quot; is a Grammy Award-winning song and hit single recorded by Puff Daddy, Faith Evans and 112, in memory of fellow Bad Boy Records artist Christopher &quot;Notorious B.I.G&quot; Wallace who was murdered on March 9, 1997.
