It is also a bonus track for 50 Cent's third album, Curtis, which will only be a bonus track on the UK edition of the album. 50 Cent has stated that it is one of his personal favorite tracks from the album, but by only reaching #65 on the Billboard charts, it's his least successful Billboard single to date apart from &quot;If I Can't&quot;, which charted at #76. However, the song remains very popular and is generally considered a fan favorite.\n \n &quot;Hustler's Ambition&quot; appears in Get Rich or Die Tryin' when 50 Cent's character Marcus performs it in concert towards the end. The song appeared in the trailer for the film.\n \n The lyrics summarize 50 Cent's rough time growing up, and how he had to &quot;hustle&quot; to keep up with life, by any means (including selling drugs). They also contain elements from Frankie Beverly &amp; Maze's song &quot;I Need You&quot;.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Hustler's Ambition&quot; is the first single (in the U.S.) and second single (in the UK and Australia) by 50 Cent from the Get Rich or Die Tryin' soundtrack, released in 2005.
