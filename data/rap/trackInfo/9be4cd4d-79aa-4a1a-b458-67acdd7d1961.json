I assume Kanye felt it added something to the verses and the song overall. It certainly doesn't ruin Jay's verses by any means.", "Probably the best track on TCD", "shut the fuck up.", "Without a doubt the shittiest song on TCD, possibly the worst song he's made.", "I was just listening to this song and it hit me how Kanye made mad noise through both of Jigga's verses up until the very end. In the first verse, he left the chorus at full blast while Jay's verse was smothered. In his own verse, the chorus was quiet in the background. Then in Jay-Z's second verse 'Ye pulls a Funkmaster Puffy and talks over it. And then I read the comments and the consensus here is that jay-Z's verses suck. Interesting. Kanye did it on purpose?!??!", "j. ivy has his prints all over this track, JESUS", "GET UP I GET GET UP I GET GET UP I GET DOWN!", "Probably the best song on TCD.
