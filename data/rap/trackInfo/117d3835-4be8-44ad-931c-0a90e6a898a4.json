[2]", "This should never be compared to the Beastie track... these two groups are highly respected in the music industry and the songs tell two different stories... on totally different vibes as was intended.  Chuck D will be the first to admit that Beastie Boys was one of the main reasons P.E. became as great as they did.  Much love to PE and Beastie Boys!", "This would not exist if it wasnt for the Beastie Boys. Ones fun, the others political.

I hate it when I just can't get with the consensus on something.", "This beats the Beastie Boys song anyday man.", "Much worse than Fight for Your Right to Party. That one at least rocked. This one's pretty weak. Also, the drum machine is atrociously limp...", "much better than fight for your right to party [3]", "cool samples in this song", "Having Chuck and Flav at the same time makes the song really intense. Fuckin awesome track.", "much better than fight for your right to party [2]", "lol I agree with the guy below me", "much better than fight for your right to party", "You know J Edgar Hoover had King and X set up.", "haha they got thu right idea YEAH YA'LL"], "toptags": {"tag": [{"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/hip-hop", "name": "hip-hop"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/rap", "name": "rap"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/hip%20hop", "name": "hip hop"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/80s", "name": "80s"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/political", "name": "political"}]}, "mbid": "117d3835-4be8-44ad-931c-0a90e6a898a4", "duration": "206000", "playcount": "120575", "id": "1083457"}}
