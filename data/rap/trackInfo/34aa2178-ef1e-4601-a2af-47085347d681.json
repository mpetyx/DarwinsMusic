It topped the U.S. charts for the week of February 17, 2001, and won a 2002 Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. It also reached number one in Germany and number two in the United Kingdom, held from the top spot by Atomic Kitten's &quot;Whole Again&quot;.\n The titular &quot;Ms. Jackson&quot; is the real-life mother of Erykah Badu, Andr\u00e9 3000's ex-girlfriend and the mother of his son Seven. The song discusses the problems that break-ups, separation, and divorce can have on a couple, and the animosity that a woman's mother can have for her daughter's former boyfriend or husband.\n The single helped sell the album following mixed reaction to the lead single &quot;B.O.B.&quot;, which, despite nearly universal acclaim from critics, failed to chart on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and only reached #69 on the Billboard Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.\n The song samples &quot;Strawberry Letter 23&quot; by The Brothers Johnson (with pitch shifting and reversing) and features an altered version of a tune from &quot;Bridal Chorus&quot; from the opera Lohengrin by German composer Richard Wagner (also known as the &quot;wedding march&quot;), played on piano.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Ms. Jackson&quot; is a song by OutKast and the second single from their fourth album Stankonia.
