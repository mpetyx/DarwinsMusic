Takeover is a lot better than Ether.", "Ether = better diss. Takeover = better actual song. [2]", "Nas won.", "Hip hop con actitud rock. Uno de los mejores desaf\u00edos en rima por escuchar.", "biatch", "Super Ugly is the best thing the whole dispute spawned...", "Fuck the Takeover and Ether debate, I love returning to this song just because Jay-Z destroyed Prodigy. You can't even argue about that one.", "I dont care what anyone say, Takeover>Ether. Ether has some corny lines. feels like a mixtape track w/o much thought.", "Nas was already on the ropes when Ether was created - let's keep that in mind. Nas managed to dent Jay-Z's rep when he was on top. Now some Jay-Z fans like to get into their head that if if weren't for Takeover, Nas would have had no buzz to feed off and his career continued to stagnate. Well damn, regardless of some undeniably fiery lines and quips, if Jay-Z 'helped' Nas by dissing him then that renders Takeover a bit of a failure in hindsight does it not?!", "Ether = better diss. Takeover = better actual song.", "Either way those \"Yea, I sampled your voice, you were using it wrong\" lines are pretty great", "Smarten up nas.", "Takeover is far better", "Big fan of both rappers, but I'd rather listen to Takeover over Ether any day. Idk why but Ether bores me.", "if you think this was better than Ether.... ur riding Shawn's D!@% to hard.", "Ether > Takeover [10]", "And all you other cats throwing shots at Jigga\nYou only get half a bar - fuck y'all niggas. \n\nBest ending ever? BOSS", "TakeOver > Ether...there I said it.", "Takeover wasn't completely funny, and Ether wasn't completely serious, if you dissect it, Jay was fucking firing shots like crazy (Nas' career), just cause he laughs about it doesn't make it any less serious, it's a serious insult. Nas pulled a ton of jokes out on Jay too that were funny, the gay/you an ugly motherfucker, but also on the serious side talked about Jay's street cred being nonexistant and basically shits on him in every way possible.", "yeah pretty obvious that jay-z won. this shit hits hard."], "toptags": {"tag": [{"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/rap", "name": "rap"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/hip-hop", "name": "hip-hop"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/jay-z", "name": "jay-z"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/hip%20hop", "name": "hip hop"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/00s", "name": "00s"}]}, "mbid": "bdefbfd0-b59c-490c-a356-6c618a2dbefe", "duration": "313000", "playcount": "446815", "id": "10624441"}}
