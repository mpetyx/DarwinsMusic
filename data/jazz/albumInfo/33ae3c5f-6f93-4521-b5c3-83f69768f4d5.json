{"album": {"wiki": {"content": "\u201cThis album coincides with a happier time in my life. I think it\u2019s very obvious in the music. It reflects how I\u2019m feeling now, the joy that I have in my marriage and family, and hopefully in the future.\u201d\n \n It had only been a few days since singer and pianist Diana Krall publicly announced that she and husband Elvis Costello were expecting their first child. Her remarks may have primarily focused on her upcoming album, but it was easy to discern the rosy glow as she discussed imminent arrivals, and how she came up with the name for one of them.\n \n \u201cI already knew before we went into the studio the title of the record. I definitely knew it was going to be From This Moment On.\u201d\n \n Cole Porter\u2019s romantic ode to great expectations (with its hip, heartening couplet, \u201cNo more blue songs/Only whoop-dee-doo songs\u201d) could not be more apt a title track for Krall\u2019s tenth album. From This Moment On is an eleven-song collection that captures the Canadian-born sensation in full swing, in great company, and at the top of her game. It could also be called her strongest, most cohesive release to date.\n \n Krall is the first to admit that the album\u2019s marked, upbeat theme was not originally her intention (\u201cI never try to link tunes together or find songs that work together as a whole. It happens organically in the recording process, or not at all.\u201d) But she does assume credit for knowing the songs she would be recording when she, her quartet and the Clayton/Hamilton Jazz Orchestra assembled for two weeks in Los Angeles\u2019s famed Capitol Studios this spring.\n \n \u201cI didn\u2019t really sit down with anybody prior to recording it and say, \u2018I think I want to do this.\u2019 I knew exactly what I wanted from the get go. I started writing down song titles last summer, but a lot of these tunes I\u2019ve had in my back pocket for years. I\u2019ve been working on \u2018How Insensitive\u2019 for about ten years. \u2018Day In, Day Out\u2019 I started working on when I was about 24. I mean these are all tunes that finally have found their place.\n \n \u201cEvery tune has to have some sort of personal connection. But I didn\u2019t want it all to be too upbeat \u2013 like \u2018Willow Weep For Me\u2019, which for me is more of a social comment, adds a question mark to that positive feeling.\u201d\n \n In songs, mood and delivery, From This Moment On reveals Krall\u2019s personal ardor for that golden era of song-making, when Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald and (especially) Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole were in their prime. It\u2019s musical territory that Krall has often explored, but this album was certainly not a case of simply repeating past formulas: Krall\u2019s A-team of support \u2013 producer Tommy LiPuma, engineer Al Schmitt and arranger/bandleader John Clayton \u2013 were on hand to ensure that inspiration was kept on an edge, unhindered by the studio environment.\n \n \u201cI\u2019m not exactly working with people who are going to just say, \u2018Oh it\u2019s lovely, Diana.\u2019 We never go an automatic pilot, you know? Sometimes I feel incredibly exposed during the recording process but fortunately I have the safety net of people whom I can listen to, and agree or disagree with. There\u2019s nobody hanging over me and saying you have to do this or that. But that doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t surprises and it can be an extraordinarily intense environment. The emotions can run high since people care so passionately about the music and what we are doing.\u201d\n \n Krall \u2013 for the few still unknowing \u2013 is the sensation whose cool, heavy-lidded vocals and strikingly sensitive piano-playing has helped her transcend barriers of genre to become a popular artist of the first order who has carved herself a permanent position at the top of the jazz charts.\n \n The seeds of Krall\u2019s crossover success are firmly rooted in her upbringing. Born in Nanaimo, Canada, to a musical family \u2013 her father is a stride-style pianist and serious record collector -- she grew up absorbing music that laid the foundation for her future growth. She attended Berklee College of Music in the early \u201880s, moved to Los Angeles where she continued her studies with the likes of bassist Ray Brown and pianist Jimmy Rowles, who convinced the young pianist to focus on her singing as well. By 1990, Krall relocated to New York City where she began performing on a regular basis with her trio. In 1993, she released her debut album on a small Canadian independent label.\n \n Thirteen years later, she can look back over a stellar career path: in \u201999, signed to Verve, her career exploded when When I Look in Your Eyes won a GRAMMY\u00a9 for best jazz vocal and became the first jazz disc to be nominated for Album of the Year in twenty-five years. In 2002, The Look of Love was a #1 bestseller in the US and a seven-time platinum album in Canada. 2004\u2019s The Girl in the Other Room, was her first to focus on her own songwriting \u2013 featuring six tunes co-written with her husband \u2013 and last year\u2019s Christmas Songs proved one of the season\u2019s best-sellers.\n \n From This Moment On delivers Krall closer than ever to her musical aspirations and, in many ways, serves as a tribute to her heroes and mentors. One can detect her gratitude in a variety of musical moments.\n \n \u201cThere\u2019s a couple of pieces that I put Ray Brown into \u2013 like his introduction to Count Basie\u2019s Little Darlin\u2019 on \u2018You Can Depend On Me\u2019 -- and a lot of [vocalist/pianist] Shirley Horn was present in \u2018Come Dance With Me.\u2019 Our treatment of \u2018From This Moment On\u2019 came together after listening to [trumpeter/composer] Kenny Dorham\u2019s version which I really love. I hear [arranger] Billy May especially in \u2018Day In Day Out.\u2019\n \n \u201cI have to mention Fred Astaire\u2019s influence on \u2018I Was Doing All Right\u2019 \u2013 and in fact, all through the album. I listened to a lot of Fred with Oscar Peterson while preparing for this project, as well as watching a lot of his early movies, like Swing Time.&quot;\n \n \u201cDo you know that great album with Duke Ellington and Frank Sinatra, where he sings \u2018Poor Butterfly\u2019? \u2018 Isn\u2019t This A Lovely Day\u2019 is very reminiscent of that. John [Clayton] wrote that arrangement at dinner the night before we recorded it. We were all sitting at a restaurant and he\u2019s got a pad of paper. He was laughing and having the conversation and you see the wheels turning at the same time. And I loved playing piano on that. I think that\u2019s my favorite piano work on the whole record \u2013 that, and \u2018Exactly Like You.\u2019\u201d\n \n Krall\u2019s piano work and her arrangements \u2013 particularly on the album\u2019s four quartet performances \u2013 are all standouts, as are a number of instrumental solos that she recalls with a marked fondness.\n \n \u201cThat\u2019s Gerald Clayton on piano on the title track -- he\u2019s an amazing piano player and I think he played the hell out of that tune. I think Jeff Clayton\u2019s alto sax solo on \u2018Isn\u2019t This A Lovely Day\u2019 is a masterpiece -- definitely one of the highlights of the record. And Terell Stafford played the perfect trumpet solo right after that! He walked in, nailed it in front of the whole band, and I said \u2018Terell, you sound like an old man.\u2019 He\u2019s only in his 30s! I meant it as the best compliment.\n \n Krall is quick to point out that she is happy with everything on the album for different reasons, especially for the collaborative results. \u201cI\u2019m proud of tunes like \u2018Exactly Like You\u2019 specifically for every little note that [guitarist] Anthony [Wilson] plays, and simply for how the subtlety can work when we all play together, and how we all play what matters.\u201d\n \n \u201cPlaying what matters\u201d could well be the subtitle to From This Moment On. There\u2019s an economy and confidence that speak to the maturity of Krall as a performer, and a recording artist. \u201cI really settled in with this record. I think I\u2019ve let go of trying to prove something, and I wasn\u2019t out to overplay solos. To just settle back into the bench and play those tough tempos and keep the solos simple and melodic and beautiful, and not have to pass a poll of some kind? That\u2019s enough.\u201d\n \n From This Moment On is also a recording that cannot help but expose Krall\u2019s feelings of being a wife and expectant mother. \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of who I am and where I am at this time. So I need to get that album out like now because that\u2019s how I feel now. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to feel six months down the road, so \u2018Only whoop-dee-doo songs\u2019? Yeah. Exactly.\u201d\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "\u201cThis album coincides with a happier time in my life.
