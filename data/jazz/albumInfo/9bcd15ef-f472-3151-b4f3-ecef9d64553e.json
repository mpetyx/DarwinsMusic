So my musical heart was scattered at the time and I wanted the album to show that.&quot;\n \n Post is the second studio album by Icelandic singer-songwriter/musician Bj\u00f6rk. It was released in June of 1995. The album was produced in conjunction with Nellee Hooper, Tricky, Graham Massey of 808 State, and electronic music producer Howie B. Building on the success of her previous album Debut, Bj\u00f6rk continued to pursue different sounds, taking particular interest in dance and techno. Production by Tricky and Howie B also provided trip hop-like sounds on tracks like &quot;Possibly Maybe&quot;. It was these producers' influence that gave Bj\u00f6rk impetus to create material like the storming &quot;Army of Me&quot; and &quot;Enjoy&quot;.However, Bj\u00f6rk had not lost her old fascination with Hollywood-style numbers. Her cover of the Betty Hutton track &quot;Blow a Fuse&quot;, retitled &quot;It's Oh So Quiet&quot;, became one of Bj\u00f6rk's most well-known moments. After &quot;Army of Me&quot; reached the UK top 10, and the subsequent release of &quot;Isobel&quot; (which did less well), One Little Indian scheduled &quot;It's Oh So Quiet&quot; as a novelty Christmas hit. To their surprise, it reached number four in December 1995; it was even later spoofed by The Smurfs. Despite Bj\u00f6rk later disowning the song[citation needed], the commercial attention led to her subsequent single releases &quot;Hyperballad&quot; and &quot;Possibly Maybe&quot; charting higher than expected.Much material was produced during the album's genesis in 1994, including &quot;I Go Humble&quot;, which would later be released as a B-side. Many of the vocals were recorded in Nassau, Bahamas by Compass Point Studios with Bj\u00f6rk standing well out into the ocean at sunset. The vocal for &quot;Cover Me&quot; was originally recorded in a nearby bat-infested cave, but was replaced in favour of the studio version. The original version of this song is found on Family Tree, a box set of rare, previously unreleased material.\n \n Post eventually went to number two on the UK Albums Chart, becoming Bj\u00f6rk's second biggest seller there after Debut. A remix album, Telegram, soon followed and Bj\u00f6rk was now officially Iceland's biggest musical export.\n \n Post has been certified platinum in the U.S.\n \n The original cover featured Bj\u00f6rk surrounded by silver balls with her tongue extended towards a falling silver ball. It was shot by Jean Baptiste Mondino, who did the sleeve for Debut. The cover was later scrapped, and re-shot by St\u00e9phane Sednaoui.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;I felt the album was the other half of Debut, so it made sense to call it Post -- before and after kinda thing. ...
