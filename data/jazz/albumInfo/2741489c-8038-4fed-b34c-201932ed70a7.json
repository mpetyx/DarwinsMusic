{"album": {"wiki": {"content": "'Round About Midnight is an album by jazz musician Miles Davis. It was his debut on Columbia Records, and was originally released in March 1957 (CL 949). The album took its name from the Thelonious Monk song &quot;'Round Midnight&quot;. Recording sessions took place at Columbia Studio D on October 26, 1955, and at Columbia's 30th Street Studio on June 5 and September 10, 1956. 'Round About Midnight is widely recognized by jazz critics as a landmark album in hard bop and one of the greatest jazz albums of all time. On April 17, 2001, Sony reissued the album for compact disc on its Columbia/Legacy label, which featured 24-bit remastering and included bonus tracks and master takes from the initial sessions. A further two-disc reissue on June 14, 2005, was released, as part of Sony's Legacy Edition series, which featured the 2001 reissue and a second disc containing Davis' celebrated Newport Jazz Festival of 1955 performance of &quot;'Round Midnight&quot;, along with a recording of the quintet's set from the 1956 Pacific Jazz Festival.\n \n At the Newport Jazz Festival in 1955, Davis performed the song &quot;'Round Midnight&quot; as part of an all-star jam session, with the song's composer Thelonious Monk, along with Connie Kay and Percy Heath of the Modern Jazz Quartet, Zoot Sims, and Gerry Mulligan. Davis's solo received an extremely positive reception from many jazz fans, and critics. It was viewed as a significant comeback and indication of a healthy, drug-free Miles (he had in fact been free from heroin addiction for well over a year). Miles's response to this performance was typically laconic: &quot;What are they talking about? I just played the way I always play.&quot; George Avakian of Columbia Records was in the audience, and his brother Aram persuaded him that he ought to sign Davis to the label. Davis was eventually signed to Columbia Records, and was able to form his famous &quot;first great quintet&quot; with John Coltrane on saxophone. 'Round About Midnight was to be his first album for his new label.\n \n Davis was still under contract to Prestige Records, but had an agreement that he could record material for Columbia to release after the expiration of his Prestige contract. The recording dates for the album were at Columbia Records studios; the first session was on October 27, 1955 at Studio D, during which the tracks &quot;Tadd's Delight&quot;, &quot;Dear Old Stockholm&quot; and the soon-to-be standard &quot;Bye Bye Blackbird&quot; were recorded. This is the first studio recording of the quintet. The remainder of the album was recorded during sessions on June 5 and September 10, 1956 at Columbia's 30th Street Studio. During the same period, the Miles Davis Quintet was also recording albums to fulfill its contract with Prestige.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "'Round About Midnight is an album by jazz musician Miles Davis.
