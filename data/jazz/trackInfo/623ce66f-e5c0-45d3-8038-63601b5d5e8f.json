Nobody lost much writing about the South.&quot; Thus, the song is universally believed to have been written about the state.\n \n It was not until Ray Charles' 1960 recording on The Genius Hits the Road that the song became a major hit, reaching the number one spot for one week in November 1960 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. On March 7, 1979, in a mutual symbol of reconciliation after conflict over civil rights issues, he performed it before the Georgia General Assembly (the state legislature). After this performance, the connection to the state was firmly made, and then the Assembly adopted it as the state song on April 24.\n tag radio : <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/georgia%20on%20my%20mind\">Georgia On My Mind</a>\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "published": "Fri, 20 Jan 2012 09:34:48 +0000", "summary": "&quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot; is a song written in 1930 by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/search?q=hoagy%20Carmichael%20on%20my%20mind&amp;type=track\">Hoagy Carmichael</a> (music) and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Stuart+Gorrell\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Stuart Gorrell</a> (lyrics).
