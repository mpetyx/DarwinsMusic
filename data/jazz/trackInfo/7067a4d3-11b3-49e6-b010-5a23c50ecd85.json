Most amazing instrumental recording i have ever heard. There is a texture to the sound, like thick velvet. My first introduction to Chris Botti and damn does he make the song, he trumpet haunts you.", "Love this version, soulful and touches your heart, amazing Micheal.", "Soulful  & Beautiful ....  just  so  nice   10 out of  ten ...", "song for me :))", "I love Michael Buble he is considered the new music of Sinatra", "wanna go to his concert so baddly ! \u03bd\u2665\u03cd\u03bd\u2665\u03cd", "Sorry, but this does not produce a fraction of the chills Donny Hathaway created with his original...", "On this I was a little disappointed. Not even a full version. I wonder how many unmentionables are thrown on stage. How will he as a crooner measure up to the earlier greats? Smokey voice yes; but lets hear an original. Look at Joe Cocker and Red; They covered other material and whats their status? Could have gone a lot further.", "Shame on whoever incorrectly tagged this.  It's \"A Song for You.\"", "The live version is so much better than the studio ver. =]", "great voice  for all woman who want to fall in love", ";( I'm crying when I listen to this song.... It's so beautiful...", "Bueno, como todo lo de este chaval.", "<3", "i love Michael's vocal but the trumpet part done by Chris Botti is also breathtaking!", "Yessss!! jazznjava/donnie you are so right!! Even though I like, somtimes love, what Bubl\u00e9 is doing, your suggestion for people to check out Herbie Hancock's and Christina Aguilera's version of, right Laura, \"A Song For You\", on Hancock's album Possibilities is a must. That version is so awesome you get goosebumps.", "Love Bubl\u00e9...awesome artist!", "This should be \"A Song For You.\"", "sch\u00f6\u00f6n"], "toptags": {"tag": [{"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz", "name": "jazz"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/michael%20buble", "name": "michael buble"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/easy%20listening", "name": "easy listening"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/male%20vocalists", "name": "male vocalists"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/swing", "name": "swing"}]}, "mbid": "7067a4d3-11b3-49e6-b010-5a23c50ecd85", "duration": "282000", "playcount": "336186", "id": "13232452"}}
