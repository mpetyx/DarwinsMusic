She explained in publicity materials: &quot;For this record, I just had a sound in my head. I wanted the grooves to be more present and heavy. And I also just wanted to do something different.&quot; She added that the new sound began to present itself on this song, which was one of the first numbers that Jones wrote for the project. &quot;About a year ago, I did some demos in my home studio,&quot; she said. &quot;I had some friends come in and we figured out a cool arrangement for 'Chasing Pirates,' with a cool drum part. It went somewhere I didn't expect it to go, and that became a direction to look in.&quot;\n \n Jones told Rolling Stone that unlike previous albums, she wrote the songs for The Fall including this one on an acoustic guitar instead of a piano. &quot;It just felt more natural for me to play it on these songs,&quot; Jones explained: &quot;I knew I wanted to play with grooves more than I have on previous albums. Some of these new songs lent themselves to having driving rhythms underneath.&quot;\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "published": "Wed, 31 Mar 2010 15:37:16 +0000", "summary": "This is the lead single from American singer-songwriter Norah Jones' fourth album, <a title=\"Norah Jones - The Fall\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Norah+Jones/The+Fall\" class=\"bbcode_album\">The Fall</a>.
