Holy shit!", "This is amazing. Thoes who think Annete sucks should listen to this!", "Mahtava biisi <3", "This is Anette's song in my opinion. She really shines here. I cant imagine Tarja doing this one at all.", "Mmmm Jazzwish noir. Cool.", "I must admit that for me it is a little weak, but cool. Such a little blues. Anette perfect to be fit for the blues.", "\"Nightwish-Noir\" OMFG. <3", "This song was inspired by Twin Peaks soundtrack, jazz elements and atmosphere from 20's /30's, \"Nightwish-Noir\"", "Nice try", "A bold experiment - and the only song that really stood out on my first listen of \"Imaginaerum\". I instantly liked it!

Please let me know ASAP if you have any interested in buying the tickets at all...please send me a private message or send me a shoutout or via my twitter user name Amethyst_CA ASAP people for THIS SUNDAY!!!", "Hmmm, I can't make my mind up on this. Sometimes I think it's a beautiful masterpiece, sometimes it bores the crap out of me! It's one of those songs you have to be in the mood for I think. I always feel relieved when I Want My Tears Back bursts in and kicks the sh*t out of this! :-). I'm glad they experimented with this, but I can't help thinking it would have been better as a b- side or album closer personally...", "Jazzwish [6] xD", "Quite nice ;) soothing.", "Awesome!", "must admit, it took me a while to get in to it, but once I did... Amazing song. [3]  Hmm, yup.....Jazzwish [5].......this is the kind of stuff they would NEVER have been able to do with Tarja.
