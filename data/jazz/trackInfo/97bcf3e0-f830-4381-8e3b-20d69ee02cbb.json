If you don't, don't listen.  I liked this album even though it was very different from some of my favorite albums from Miles Davis.", "As fresh as ever.", "They actually sampled the drums.", "Opening bass rythim is definitely the inspiration to Radiohead's b-side \"Kinetic\".", "Hadn't listened to this in ages - it's amazing. If you put it next to the o.t.t. .excess  of what came later - 'Dark Magus', 'Black Beauty' etc. Miles' sense of economy really shines through. It might be electric period Miles, but it looks back to 'Kind of Blue' as much as it looks forward.", "Smooth, classic Miles.", "love it.   always did, from the 1st listening when it came out.", "Miles is  a surprise en every single note!", "No not for me !!", "Remember when people used to buy CDs? I would not have bought this CD, knowing that I'd only listen to it once every few years. But here, in the mix, it's just right.", "very gooood for a sunday morning , GETZ me straightend out for a week \nAT LEAST", "everybody aught to , but would it be as anything alike ?", "Genius!!!  The way the instruments mesh together-Trumpet, bass, drums, guitar, percussion...divinity to my ears.", "legendary", "Boo", "my fav by Miles", "Its like being stabbed with funk. in a good way", "come over \nlet's play some music\nwith some friends", "like blue  byrd :D"], "id": "6967", "listeners": "107096", "duration": "739000", "playcount": "284697", "toptags": {"tag": [{"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz", "name": "jazz"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz%20fusion", "name": "jazz fusion"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/fusion", "name": "fusion"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/sonicuniverse", "name": "sonicuniverse"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/somafm", "name": "somafm"}]}}
