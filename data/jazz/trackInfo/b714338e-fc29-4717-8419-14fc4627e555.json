I didn't own it either for a long time, but I finally got it after ordering the Frank & Back to Black box set last fall. I always knew the song existed existed, but to me it was brand new when I heard it last year. Knowing she had died made the lyrics seem especially poignant. I can appreciate people wishing that she \"could have helped herself\" and all that--the notion of course being that she needed to take her own advice--but I still appreciate the subtle wisdom in these lyrics.

When are they going to direct research to \"resetting\" the brain? Call me jaded but I think it's likely because treatment is big business ... and like other treatments that go on and on with short term results... a cure would put them all out of business. We see this with cancer all the time. Same is true with addiction... which of course has a large behavioral component as well. --Maria Grandonico Ludlam", "wish she could have helped herself...
