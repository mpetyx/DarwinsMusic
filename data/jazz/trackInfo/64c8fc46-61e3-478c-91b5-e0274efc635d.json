Then we get choruses from Stan Getz who takes the piece to the end.   Getz played with superb feeling for the Latin jazz fusion without trying to stamp too much pure American jazz onto it. So it was a respectful mix of the two separate worlds.\n \n There was some ill feeling on the part of the Brazillian musicians in the years after Bossa Nova, as they felt the purity of their national music heritage was being &quot;sold out&quot; to American commercial interests.  Maybe it did and probably because it leant a little on the Pop Music world for popularity but even so the genre has lasted superbly and longer than anything from the 60s apart from Jazz itself.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Classic 1960s Bossa Nova, recorded just after the genre was grafted into American Jazz.\n Antonio Carlos Jobim who was practically the inventor of Bossa Nova, sings with his unmistakable laid back syncopated vocals that have a style all his own.
