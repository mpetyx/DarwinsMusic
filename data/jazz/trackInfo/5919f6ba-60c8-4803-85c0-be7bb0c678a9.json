Cuban percussionist <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mongo+Santamar%C3%ADa\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Mongo Santamar&iacute;a</a> released the tune as a latin pop single the next year on Battle Records, where it became a surprise hit, reaching #10 on the pop charts. Santamar\u00eda's recording was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998. Hancock radically re-worked the tune, combining elements of funk, for the album <a title=\"Herbie Hancock - Head Hunters\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Herbie+Hancock/Head+Hunters\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Head Hunters</a> (1973).\n \n ---\n \n This track is taken from <a title=\"Herbie Hancock - Cantaloupe Island\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Herbie+Hancock/Cantaloupe+Island\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Cantaloupe Island</a> and is not the funky version from <a title=\"Herbie Hancock - Headhunters\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Herbie+Hancock/Headhunters\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Headhunters</a>. It is a very simple number with only 3 chords in it, which makes for some really laid back soloing. Unusually for jazz of the time, the piano plays a funky riff which continues throughout, except of course where Herbie needs both hands for his own solo! It is a milestone piece from one of the world's most influential jazzers.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "published": "Tue, 3 Feb 2009 19:19:27 +0000", "summary": "&quot;Watermelon Man&quot; is a jazz standard written by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Herbie+Hancock\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Herbie Hancock</a>, first released on his debut album, <a title=\"Herbie Hancock - Takin' Off\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Herbie+Hancock/Takin%27+Off\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Takin' Off</a> (1962), in a grooving hard bop version that featured improvisations by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Freddie+Hubbard\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Freddie Hubbard</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Dexter+Gordon\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Dexter Gordon</a>.
