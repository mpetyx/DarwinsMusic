Second time was at his opening of our area's first huge scale entertainment arena with the man I would marry on one of our earlier dates. Great time all around.", "This is how it was and it's PERFECT!

Anyone can lift a vocal track and lay it over background music but to get it right in one try,  THAT is artistry.  We need more of this, more recordings from 78 RPM records with all of the buzz, pop and hiss that went with it.", "The audio quality of this track is awful.
