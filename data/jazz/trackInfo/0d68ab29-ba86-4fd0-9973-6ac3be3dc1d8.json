The track became the fourth and final track from the album to be released as a single, peaking the #44 position in the UK. Played throughout the 1985/86 tour, a live version of the track recorded in Arnhem can be found on the \u2018Bring on The Night\u2019 album. The song made a surprise but welcome reappearance on the \u2018Brand New Day\u2019 tour, where it was given a new lease of life thanks to Chris Botti's trumpet and Sting's gravelly vocals - a cross between Tom Waits and Louis Armstrong.\n \n In 2003, Sting re-recorded \u2018Moon\u2019 as a B-side on the CD-single \u2018Send Your Love\u2019, which hit as high as #30 in the UK music charts. The re-recording includes a solo acoustic guitar accompanying the vocals, giving the song a modern combination of blues and latino rhythms. TBS chose \u2018Moon\u2019 as the ending theme song for the Japanese drama Loved to Love, probably to fit the dancing style of Kuroki Hitomi's character in the series.\n \n &quot;Moon Over Bourbon Street\u2019 was originally written to describe a character from Anne Rice's &quot;Interview with a Vampire&quot;.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Moon Over Bourbon Street appears on Sting's 1985 debut solo album \u2018The Dream of the Blue Turtles\u2019.
