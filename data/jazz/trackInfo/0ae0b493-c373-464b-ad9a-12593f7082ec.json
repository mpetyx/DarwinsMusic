Trenet's French version was an homage and ode to the changing moods of the sea, while Lawrence, by just adding one word &quot;Beyond&quot; to the title, gave him the start whereby he made the song into one of a lover pining for a lost love.[1]\n \n It has been recorded by many artists, including Benny Goodman, Mantovani, Roger Williams and Gisele MacKenzie, but Bobby Darin's version released in 1959 is the best known by many, reaching #6 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song reached the top 40 twice prior to the Darin version (Goodman-1948, Williams-1955).\n \n \n  Performances by Darin\n \n Darin's recording has been used in many films, TV shows and video games, including Apollo 13, Austin Powers in Goldmember, Diner, Goodfellas, Lost, Black Rain, The X-Files, The Adventures of Ford Fairlaine and BioShock. The song was also played in a 2005 commercial for Carnival Cruise Lines. A portion of Bobby Darin's recording was played during the splashdown and post-recovery of Alan Shepard's Freedom 7 in the first episode of the 1998 HBO miniseries, From the Earth to the Moon.\n \n Performances as Darin\n \n Kevin Spacey sang the song in the movie Beyond the Sea, a biopic about Bobby Darin, \n in a &quot;fantasy&quot; sequence leading up to his marriage to Sandra Dee. Similarly, on the television series American Dreams, Duncan Sheik performed the song while playing the role of Bobby Darin.\n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Beyond the Sea&quot; is a 1946 contemporary pop song with music taken from the song &quot;La Mer&quot; by Charles Trenet and lyrics by Jack Lawrence.
