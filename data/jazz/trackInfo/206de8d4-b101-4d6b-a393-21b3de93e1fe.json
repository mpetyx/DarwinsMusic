You can hear in this version the remnants of his inability to bridge the gaps between his usual smooth transitions due to the destruction of his teeth from a drug related beating . I'd never noticed the difference so clearly", "Featured in the film 'The Guard'. I think I could forgive my assassin if he told me not to stop the record as he too liked Chet Baker.", "your answer was goodbye & there was even postage due..", "Depressive and beautiful.", "Never gets old!", "There is something so sad about the way he sings but it is so mesmerizing and full of sentiment.  It's unfortunate how we died and how is life took a turn for the worse.  He's awesome!", "Kinda like some songs from the 1940's. Smooth and relaxing.", "his singing is so relaxed. Like an opposite to his quite short life. Chet Baker is a musical genious.", "I just noticed the version of this song that's on here is different from the version I have. My copy (just a random MP3 i got years and years ago) is almost a minute and a half longer at 6:25 and includes an instrumental introduction featuring Chet on Trumpet. Anyone know where this one's from? I like the version I have better than the one on this site, to tell the truth.", "good", "rahat lokum", "I've fallen in love with Chet. What a voice,smooth and mellow.Mmmmmm!", "adore this song. Chet as excellent as always.", "true... :(", "everyone has these days...", "I love Chet", "most depressive song ever.
