The version featured here is one of the older examples of Louis Armstrong playing the tune, probably with his Hot Seven in the 1930's.  Louis used the tune regularly in concerts. It is his  introduction and first chorus are copied verbatim by better practioners of traditional New Orleans Jazz in the US and around the world making this likely the most emulated jazzwork of all time so far.\n \n The West End Blues is often accredited to Joe &quot;King&quot; Oliver. King Oliver also was responsible for encouraging a young Louis Armstrong to follow him from New Orleans to Chicago. That move helped bring Armstrong to national attention long before the Twenties were over.\n \n Louis recorded the West End Blues several times during his career.  A good example of a mature Sachmo playing the tune can be found on the Columbia Ambasador Satch LP/CD.\n \n arthurwatalltel\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Everyday, somewhere, a trumpet or cornet player tries to render an emulation of Louis Armstrong playing the West End Blues.
