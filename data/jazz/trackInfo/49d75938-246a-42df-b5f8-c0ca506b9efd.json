IN CONTEXT it is and was a groundbreaking album by luminaries of the Jazz world.  Neven before had Jazz and Rock been fused (hence the fusion label) so concisely or so popularly.  This album sold millions because when it came out it was as different as the Black Keys today, Nine Inch Nails in the 90's, Yello in the 80's. Not everybody liked it but it definitely struck a chord with the masses. I personally think that it still sounds better than most of the jazz that is still coming out.  Definitely better than anything you will hear on commercial radio on any continent today. This is my opinion, you are welcome to disagree.", "Holy disco-jazz batman!

But you should have seen this done live!!!\nThe Live at Beacon Street Theatre cd, I was there!!!", "All-stars", "Holy disco-jazz batman!", "The intro is choice.
