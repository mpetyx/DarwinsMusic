I'm bowled over Mr. H.H. by your vibrant victorious virtuosity variously visionary and vacuous like the voyage you are on.", "I get lost in the keys...nice :-)", "haha.", "StuartHaden1, you express your self in a very jazzy, cogent and cool way! I dig it.", "Freddie's on song. Tony and Herbie are there too. Tight as a man from Scotland. Geddit? Drunk with power. Superb and fit for purpose. Hop on board. It's a maiden voyage so the waters may be choppy but with any luck we will enjoy the journey and get to the other side without drowning in misery.", "This is a great seminal work by Herbie Hancock. And I do love it!  However, last .FM please note that this tune has been played 172 times for me out of 173 times for all of Herbie Hancock. He has a whole body of diverse great work out there, like \"Watermelon Man\" for one. How about it, last.fm?", "One of my favorite jazz tracks.
