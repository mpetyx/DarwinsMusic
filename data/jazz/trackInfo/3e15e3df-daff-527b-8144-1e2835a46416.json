Bake it, man. Rich and off key as can be, he could play a swing with a tune and tap a key with a digit or two. And Coltrane fills the gap beautifully.", "great story about the time he was in Japan and was fitted for a suit lying in bed...", "Monk original?I doub it but anyway enjoyable", "This isn't John Coltrane on tenor, it's Johnny Griffin.", "I like the Basses too - waiting for Coltrane - wonder when he appears....", "t.monk rules...", "to StuartHaden1: but they also sooooooo different: Monk is making the gap to let fill them up while Coltrane feed with all the detail to the max to the point of no-more-room already to think ;-) But I love it. They were so different and thus completed each other.", "viva el monje telonio", "Just wonderful tracks . . . so glad we can listen again and again.", "and there's another nut on that sax... John Coltrane. I'm nuts about them both.", "Nutty as fruit cake? Or just plain nutty! The best nut is a walnut because it is rich in Omega three. This nut is easy to crack. It's by a wizard of jazz improvisation and inventiveness. His distinctive sound is instantly recognisable. Heard and saw him play years ago in London. He was a genius.\r\nThe piano is in perfect order, that's just the way he plays on the keys.", "leader!!", "GREAT", "monky jazzy", "Wonderful song."], "toptags": {"tag": [{"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz", "name": "jazz"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/bebop", "name": "bebop"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/piano", "name": "piano"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz%20piano", "name": "jazz piano"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/easy%20listening", "name": "easy listening"}]}, "mbid": "", "duration": "319000", "playcount": "103430", "id": "1141918"}}
