Miller's rendition topped the charts one year later and was featured in the 1941 movie Sun Valley Serenade. The song is an anomaly to chart purists. &quot;In The Mood&quot; was released in the period immediately prior to the inception of retail sales charts in Billboard magazine. While it led the Record Buying Guide (jukebox list) for 13 weeks, it never made the top 15 on the sheet music charts, which were considered by many to be the true measure of popular song success. The popular Your Hit Parade program ranked the song no higher than ninth place, for one week only (1940).\n \n It opens with a now-famous sax section theme, and is joined by trumpets and trombones after 13 counts. It has two main solo sections; a &quot;tenor fight&quot; solo\u2014in the most famous recording, between Tex Beneke and Al Klink\u2014and a 16-bar trumpet solo. It is also famous for its ending.\n Origins\n \n The song was composed by Joe Garland and Andy Razaf, and arranged by Glenn Miller.

A story says that after &quot;In the Mood&quot; became a hit, Manone was paid by Miller and his record company not to contest the copyright.\n \n The main theme also occurs in the Horace Henderson arrangement of &quot;<a title=\"Fletcher Henderson &ndash; Hot and Anxious\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Fletcher+Henderson/_/Hot+and+Anxious\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Hot and Anxious</a>&quot;; recorded by his brother's band - The <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Flecther+Henderson\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Flecther Henderson</a> Orchestra.\n \n <strong>Renditions</strong>\n \n Other notable big band artists who recorded the song include the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Joe+Loss+Orchestra\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Joe Loss Orchestra</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Andrews+Sisters\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Andrews Sisters</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Xavier+Cugat\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Xavier Cugat</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tommy+Dorsey\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Tommy Dorsey</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Duke+Ellington\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Duke Ellington</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Benny+Goodman\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Benny Goodman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Artie+Shaw\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Artie Shaw</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Lubo+D%27Orio\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Lubo D'Orio</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Puppini+Sisters\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Puppini Sisters</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Brian+Setzer+Orchestra\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Brian Setzer Orchestra</a>.\n \n Non-big band renditions were recorded by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jerry+Lee+Lewis\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Jerry Lee Lewis</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Chet+Atkins\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Chet Atkins</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Haley+&amp;+His+Comets\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Bill Haley &amp; His Comets</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bad+Manners\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Bad Manners</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ernie+Fields\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Ernie Fields</a>, whose version charted at number 4 in the U.S. in 1959.
