Anything from Miles i like, but the \"cool jazz\" period is the best.", "my heavy rotation and favorite song,cooooooooooooooooooool!!", "Miles & 'Trane!", "One of the best from Miles.", "Your probably right Gioele_Emperor. It's just funny from my perspective being born in V\u00e4rmland and have sung the song in choirs since I was a kid long before I heard of Miles.", "all these out-takes and previously unreleased tracks... oh well. Philly Joe and Paul Chambers it aint! Try and find first recording if you can.", "i don't think that getz's problem was 'not knowing geography'. \nhe re-arranged and re-made a traditional regional song for a worldwide jazz audience , so he just chose a title more fitting for an international public (Dear Old Stockholm: easy, fashionable, containing a well-known and well-visited placename) instead of a swedish tongue-twister like \"Vaermlandsvisan\". just my two cents, tho'.", "Very good...", "such an amazing track.....", "Think it was Stan Getz who first made a jazz version of this. Anyway, he didn't know much about swedish geography: In sweden this song is called \"V\u00e4rmlandsvisan\" and is an official song of the state V\u00e4rmland, while Stockholm (the capital) is in a way different part of the country.\n\nBut it's still a wonderful melody and it's great he turned the world on to it (if it was Getz who reinterpreted it.)", "This is not the version on 'Round Midnight ... Don't you hear the Brass Section?", "He cierto, qu\u00e9 se puede decir ante semejante cancion y artista.", "asta hembra melastes!!", "Hola desde M\u00e9xico! No cabe duda buscando algo bueno,encontr\u00e9 una buena m\u00fasica. Soy amante del jazz.", "Hi qalkyne3! I've been to and around Zimbabwe - keep my fingers crossed things will work out for you! Sooner than you think.
