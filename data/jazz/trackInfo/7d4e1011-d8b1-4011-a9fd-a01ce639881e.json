She sounds great!", "The piece first appeared as \"The Stolen Moment\" on the 1960 album \"Trane Whistle\" by Eddie \"Lockjaw\" Davis, which was largely written and co-arranged by Oliver Nelson. It was not marked out as anything special, in fact the covernotes only mention that the trumpet solo is by Bob Bryant and that Eric Dolphy's bass clarinet can be heard briefly on the closing. However, in the liner notes to Eric Dolphy: The Complete Prestige Recordings, Bill Kirchner states that this incorrectly credits Dolphy with playing what's actually the baritone saxophone of George Barrow, with Dolphy's contribution to the piece being the 2nd alto behind Nelson. Its first well-known recording was the version on Nelson's own 1961 album The Blues and the Abstract Truth. Nelson's solo on this version contains \"possibly the most famous\" use of the augmented scale in jazz. >> Frank Zappa also covered the song on the \"Broadway the Hard Way\" album.", "Beautiful song \u2764 \u2022\u266a\u266b\u2022*\u00a8*\u2022 .\u266c", "Dolphy Magic.", "Fantastic!", "thanks to bobgreen for mentioning this gem to me...vinyl available @ amazon...only $70", "This IS Oliver Nelson and it's very very cool", "This is NOT Oliver Nelson, that's for sure", "Awesome version! who da hell is performing it?", "Stunner", "Thats better", "ditto ditto and ditto!! to all of the shouts!!\r\n\r\njazz lives!", "A wonderful song from a great album."], "toptags": {"tag": [{"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz", "name": "jazz"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/saxophone", "name": "saxophone"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/bebop", "name": "bebop"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/cool%20jazz", "name": "cool jazz"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/trumpet", "name": "trumpet"}]}, "mbid": "7d4e1011-d8b1-4011-a9fd-a01ce639881e", "duration": "528000", "playcount": "122657", "id": "1747981"}}
