The track follows in the footsteps of Winehouse's previous singles of a mix of jazz and R&amp;B with her soulful, raspy vocals and this time hip hop-inspired beats over it. Recorded solo, and then again with guest vocals from <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wu-Tang+Clan\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wu-Tang Clan</a> member <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ghostface+Killah\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Ghostface Killah</a>, the original appeared on Winehouse's album, and the version featuring Ghostface Killah appears on his album, <a title=\"Ghostface Killah - More Fish\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ghostface+Killah/More+Fish\" class=\"bbcode_album\">More Fish</a>.\n \n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Arctic+Monkeys\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Arctic Monkeys</a> covered this song on Jo Whiley's Live Lounge on BBC Radio 1 in their second appearance there, along with their single at the time, &quot;[track artist=arctic monkeys]Brianstorm&quot;. In the summer of 2007, &quot;You Know I'm No Good&quot; was also incorporated into ads for AMC's TV drama Mad Men, as well as the opening to ITV's Secret Diary of a Call Girl. On the recap of The Best Songs of 2007 by Entertainment Weekly magazine, this song ranked at number two.\n \n <strong>Music video</strong>\n \n The music video, directed by Phil Griffin (who also directed the video for her previous hit &quot;Rehab&quot;), was released to music channels in late November 2006. The video features Winehouse in numerous settings including a bar, a bedroom, and a bathtub. The plot is based around Winehouse's fictional character's relationship with the male character in the video.\n \n The video premiered on VH1 during the weekend of 3 March 2007. Following its VH1 premiere, it was placed on MTV's Big 10 rotation as of 5 March 2007 and was premiered on TRL the same day.\n \n <strong>Release</strong>\n \n The single was released in the UK on 8 January 2007. The track made it onto BBC Radio 1's A-list playlist. A UK edit of the remix featuring Ghostface Killah was also sent to radio, and to download services, and the original full-length U.S. version, featuring Ghostface Killah name checking Kelly Clarkson amongst others, is also receiving airplay in the U.S., where it has been added to numerous Rhythmic radio stations.\n \n Following Winehouse's success at the 50th Grammy Awards, the song was re-released in the U.S. in mid-February 2008.\n \n <strong>Response</strong>\n \n Critical response to the single was positive. For the week of 16 January 2007, the track was chosen as the Single of the Week on the U.S. iTunes Store as a free download. Newsweek also chose the song as its Pick of the Week for 15 January of the same year. Billboard found that the track\u2014&quot;in original form\u2014could be no better&quot;, however, it acknowledged that the Ghostface Killah remix added a &quot;ferocious discordant sputter at the midsection.&quot; People magazine called the track &quot;instantly memorable.&quot;\n Prior to this, Winehouse had not seen any success in the U.S., as her debut album Frank was not released there until November 2007. On the Billboard Hot 100, &quot;You Know I'm No Good&quot; debuted at number ninety\u2014one spot ahead of &quot;Rehab&quot;, which also debuted on the chart the same week. The single peaked on the UK Singles Chart at number eighteen for the week ending 14 January 2007, in an excellent week for Winehouse that saw Back to Black achieve a new UK peak of number one, previous single &quot;Rehab&quot; return to the UK top twenty, and Frank re-enter the UK chart at number sixty-two more than three years after its first release. To date, the single, which spent a total of eleven consecutive weeks on the UK Singles Chart, has sold 53,272 copies in the UK.\n \n Winehouse performed the song at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony while in London, along with her hit single &quot;Rehab&quot;. The performance was broadcast internationally via satellite. The song's performance on the awards ceremony subsequently led to an increase in digital downloads, notably on iTunes, where the song reentered the Top Songs chart at number fifty-five in the United States. This resulted in a new peak for the song on the Billboard Hot 100, of number seventy-seven, one spot ahead of its previous peak. Arctic Monkeys performed a cover of the song on their 2007 tour. According to Mediabase.com, &quot;You Know I'm No Good&quot; is being sent back to U.S. radio for another attempt. Following the performance, the song re-entered the Hot 100 at number seventy-seven, based on digital sales.\n \n A remix by Ghostface Killah appears on the reissue of Back to Black, featuring one verse by Ghostface, and a second remix, featuring more Ghostface verses appears on his album More Fish.\n \n English actor Roger Moore said he had no idea why Winehouse chose to include him in the lyrics, unless she wanted a word that rhymed with &quot;door&quot;, or could not find a word that rhymed with &quot;Connery&quot;.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "published": "Mon, 7 Sep 2009 07:06:57 +0000", "summary": "&quot;You Know I'm No Good&quot; is the second single from Amy Winehouse's second studio album, Back to Black (2006).
