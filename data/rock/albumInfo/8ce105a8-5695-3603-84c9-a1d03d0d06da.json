On side A of each of the discs is the album track, and on the B-side are non-album tracks. It is also one of the last five albums, in order of chronology, to be placed in the &quot;<em>1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die</em>&quot;. Hot Fuss sold more than 2,500,000 copies in the first year of its release. After being nominated for five Grammys, it has since sold more than 5,000,000 copies worldwide.\n \n <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>Murder Trilogy</strong></span>:\n \n 2 of the songs on the album (&quot;<a title=\"The Killers &ndash; Jenny Was a Friend of Mine\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Killers/_/Jenny+Was+a+Friend+of+Mine\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Jenny Was a Friend of Mine</a>&quot; and &quot;<a title=\"The Killers &ndash; Midnight Show\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Killers/_/Midnight+Show\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Midnight Show</a>&quot;) are a continuing story along with &quot;<a title=\"The Killers &ndash; Leave the Bourbon on the Shelf\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Killers/_/Leave+the+Bourbon+on+the+Shelf\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Leave the Bourbon on the Shelf</a>&quot; from <a title=\"The Killers - Sawdust\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Killers/Sawdust\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Sawdust</a>, which is known as the <em>Murder Trilogy</em>. The band have also said they may expand this in the future. The order of the songs is the reverse of how they appeared on the albums, with &quot;Leave the Bourbon On The Shelf&quot; being first, followed by &quot;Midnight Show&quot; and finally &quot;Jenny Was a Friend of Mine&quot;. In their official biography the Killers explain a few of the theories behind the Murder Trilogy. For example Brandon Flowers says &quot;<em>There was water involved, although he didn\u2019t drown her</em>.&quot;\n \n Hot Fuss was released on June 7, 2004 in the United Kingdom and on June 15, 2004 in the United States.

Rolling Stone gave the album three-and-a-half stars out of five. Reviewer Jenny Eliscu compared the band's music to contemporaries The Rapture and Franz Ferdinand, stating that in comparison to those groups The Killers &quot;have actual pop songs -- in spades&quot;. Eliscu concluded, &quot;This album is all Killers, no filler.&quot; In a mixed review, Entertainment Weekly wildly praised the song &quot;Somebody Told Me&quot; while asking &quot;As for the rest, isn't it a little too early for a Strokes tribute band?&quot;, and ultimately gave the album a &quot;C&quot;.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Hot Fuss is the debut album by Las Vegas-based post-punk revival band <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Killers\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Killers</a>, first released in 2004.
