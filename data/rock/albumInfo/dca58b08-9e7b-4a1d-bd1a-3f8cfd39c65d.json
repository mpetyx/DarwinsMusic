{"album": {"wiki": {"content": "Evanescence is the self-titled third studio album by American rock band Evanescence. The album is scheduled for release on October 11, 2011, through Wind-up Records.\n The band started the writing process for the album on June 2009. The release of the album was changed several times. First, on February 22, 2010 the band entered in the studio with the producer Steve Lillywhite but later they stopped recording the album with him because &quot;it wasn't coming out nicely&quot;. During that time the album was scheduled for an August or September 2010 release, but Lee later announced that Evanescence had left the studio. On April 11, 2011, the band went back into the studio with a new producer, Nick Raskulinecz, and tracking was completed on July 8, 2011.\n The first single from the album, &quot;What You Want&quot;, was released on August 9, 2011.\n \n In a news posting to the Evanescence website during June 2009, Amy Lee wrote that the band was in the process of writing new material for a new album proposed for release in 2010. She stated that the music would be an evolution of previous works and be &quot;better, stronger, and more interesting&quot;. Evanescence entered the studio on February 22 to begin recording. Will Hunt returned as drummer while a second drummer and programmer, Will &quot;Science&quot; Hunt, was brought in to assist in writing but ultimately did not join the band. David Campbell, who previously worked on The Open Door, was brought back to handle string arrangements, and the album was scheduled for release by the producer Steve Lillywhite. Lee later said that &quot;Steve wasn't the right fit&quot;.\n In an interview with Billboard Lee said, &quot;After finishing touring [behind 2006 album The Open Door], I just sort of took off and didn't know what I was going to do next and wasn't sure if the Evanescence thing would happen again or when it would.&quot; She took a break from music for 18 months and in the end she decided she &quot;wanted to work with the guys, and it became more of a group project&quot;. Lee also admitted that she had an identity crisis saying, &quot;[The success with] 'Fallen' happened really fast, and it was just go, go, go for a couple years, and we went right into writing and wrote the next record. By the time we finished touring with 'The Open Door,' I just needed to go, 'Who am I as an adult?'&quot; She added that in the new album everyone had some part, &quot;Usually it's me and one main co-writer.[...] This time everybody had something to do with it from the ground up.&quot;\n \n At the time the band began recording, the album was intended for an August or September 2010 release. However, on June 21, 2010, Lee announced on EvThreads.com that Evanescence had temporarily left the studio to work further on the album and &quot;get our heads into the right creative space&quot;. Lee also indicated that record label Wind-up was going through &quot;uncertain times&quot;, which will further delay the release of the album. Wind-up Records president Ed Vetri supported Lee's decision to start recording all over again. &quot;One thing we do at Wind-up is, we're patient. I[f] it's not right, it's not coming out. If it takes a year or four years, [we're] going to take the time it needs to write the right record.&quot; Having visited the studio several times to witness the album progressing, he states that &quot;I think her core fans will be really happy.&quot;\n The band reentered the studio in early April with 19 songs and new producer Nick Raskulinecz, who has produced music for Alice in Chains and Foo Fighters, to continue work on their third album, which was recorded in Blackbird Studio in Nashville. After an initial denial by band management, on June 12 Lee confirmed that Troy McLawhorn had rejoined the band as a guitarist. At the same time, Lee announced that the album would be released on October 4, 2011, which was later pushed back to October 11 by Wind-up Records.\n \n \n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Evanescence is the self-titled third studio album by American rock band Evanescence.
