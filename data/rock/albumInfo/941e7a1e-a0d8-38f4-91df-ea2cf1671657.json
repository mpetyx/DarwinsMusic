{"album": {"wiki": {"content": "Tragic Kingdom is the third studio album by American third wave ska band No Doubt, released on October 10, 1995, by Trauma Records, a division of Interscope Records. The album was produced by Matthew Wilder and was recorded in eleven different studios across California between March 1993 and October 1995. The album takes its name from the nickname Tom Dumont's teacher had for Disneyland in California \u2013 a pun on the nickname &quot;The Magic Kingdom&quot;.\n \n Following the release of the band's debut album, No Doubt (1992), Interscope Records paired the band with producer Matthew Wilder and rejected much of the band's material, refusing to let them record a second album under Interscope. This alienated songwriter Eric Stefani, who withdrew from and eventually left the band in 1994. Frustrated by their lack of progress with Interscope, No Doubt recorded and released their second album, The Beacon Street Collection (1995), independently. It sold 100,000 copies and ensured that Interscope would finance another album. During one of the recording sessions for Tragic Kingdom, No Doubt met Paul Palmer, owner of Trauma Records, who persuaded Interscope to sign No Doubt to him and released the album under his own label.\n \n Upon its release, Tragic Kingdom received mixed reviews from music critics. It sold over sixteen million copies worldwide and was certified Diamond in the U.S. and Canada, Platinum in the UK and triple Platinum in Australia. At the 39th Grammy Awards, No Doubt earned nominations for Best New Artist and Best Rock Album. The album's sales helped to initiate the ska revival of the 1990s, persuading record labels to sign more ska bands and helping them attract mainstream attention. Tragic Kingdom yielded seven singles from 1995 to 1998, including &quot;Just a Girl&quot;, &quot;Spiderwebs&quot;, &quot;Excuse Me Mr.&quot;, &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; and &quot;Don't Speak&quot;.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Tragic Kingdom is the third studio album by American third wave ska band No Doubt, released on October 10, 1995, by Trauma Records, a division of Interscope Records.
