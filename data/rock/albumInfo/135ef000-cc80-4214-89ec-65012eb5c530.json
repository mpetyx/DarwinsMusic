{"album": {"wiki": {"content": "Keep the Faith is the fifth studio album by American rock band Bon Jovi, released on November 3, 1992 by Mercury Records. The RIAA certified it Double Platinum for two million shipments throughout the United States. The album has sold over 10 million copies worldwide to date. Keep The Faith was ranked number 21 on Kerrang magazine's list of the 100 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. The album also featured in the Classic Rock &amp; Metal Hammer 's The 200 Greatest Albums Of The 90's. The album was remastered and re-released in 1998, adding the Live From London performance of &quot;Keep the Faith&quot; as a bonus track.\n \n Following the completion of New Jersey tour, the band went on hiatus. During their time off, Jon Bon Jovi wrote the soundtrack for Young Guns II, which was released in 1990 as the Blaze of Glory album and Richie Sambora released his first solo album called Stranger In This Town. By this time, Jon Bon Jovi fired his long time manager, Doc McGhee and created Bon Jovi Management. Jon decided to take on a larger role, and more responsibilities within the band. The band quickly became a corporation with Jon at the helm.\n \n In October 1991 the band went to a Caribbean island of St. Thomas to discuss plans for the future; the band's internal problems were solved and they were ready to have a go at a comeback. In January 1992 they headed to Little Mountain Studios in Vancouver. They spent six months making the album with Bob Rock producing. Keep The Faith was released in October 1992. The musical tastes had shifted in the four years between New Jersey and Keep the Faith. Despite the industry's and audience's growing affinity for Grunge rock, Bon Jovi's sound morphed itself to work in the 1990s music scene, and also their image changed. Before the band reunited in the studio, Jon Bon Jovi spent the summer of 1991 in anonymity, riding his bike in places like Arizona, experiences that inspired him to write Dry County and Bed Of Roses. He later commented &quot;I would never been possible to write songs like Bed of Roses or Dry County five years ago.&quot;.\n \n A single for &quot;Keep the Faith&quot; was put out prior to the album's release with the song, &quot;I Wish Everyday Could Be Like Christmas&quot; appearing as the B-Side.\n \n Keep The Faith released in November 1992. The album managed to sell 2 million copies in United States, peaked at #5 on the Billboard 200 and spent total of 49 weeks on the chart. The album produced three Top 40 hits. &quot;Keep The Faith&quot; hit the #1 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, &quot;Bed of Roses&quot; hit the Top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and &quot;In These Arms&quot; hit the Top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n \n In the UK, reaction was quite impressive. Keep The Faith debuted there at #1, and spent 24 weeks inside the Top 20. Keep The Faith spent a total of 95 weeks inside the Top 200 of the UK Albums Chart. The album produced six UK Top 20 hit singles, three of which were hit the Top 10. These were &quot;Keep The Faith&quot;, &quot;Bed Of Roses&quot;, &quot;In These Arms&quot;, &quot;I'll Sleep When I'm Dead&quot;, &quot;I Believe&quot; and &quot;Dry County&quot;. Keep The Faith was also a huge success in Canada, Germany, Australia, Japan and sold very well in both Asia and South America, two emerging and growing record markets. To date, the album has sold 10 million copies world wide.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Keep the Faith is the fifth studio album by American rock band Bon Jovi, released on November 3, 1992 by Mercury Records.
