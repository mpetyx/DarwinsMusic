{"album": {"wiki": {"content": "Greatest Hits is a compilation album by the American rock band Guns N' Roses, released on March 23, 2004. It was released by Geffen in part because of the delay in the making of Chinese Democracy, and the subject of lawsuits by band member Axl Rose and ex band members in an attempt to block its release due to its track listing. Despite the album having almost no promotion it reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and number three on the Billboard 200 chart upon its release. Greatest Hits re-entered the Billboard 200 at number three in March 2012, selling about 85,000 copies as part of a promotion by both Amazon MP3 and Google Play that saw the album sold for 25 cents for one day. The album has proven a popular seller, selling over 5.2 million copies in the United States, as of 2012. Although the album received mainly positive reviews and sold well, fans criticized the track listing, citing lack of some popular songs and too many covers, as reason for complaint. Axl Rose immediately tried to block the release by suing Geffen, saying it would ruin his focus on Chinese Democracy and if he were to get the album finished and released sooner, the Greatest Hits album would be selling more, leaving the album unnoticed. Former bandmates Slash and Duff McKagan helped Rose file the lawsuit against Geffen, although they did not speak to each other in person. This failed and the album was released under Geffen Records' rights. The album omits several singles released by the band between 1987 and 1999: &quot;It's So Easy&quot;, &quot;Nightrain&quot;, &quot;Estranged&quot;, &quot;Hair of the Dog&quot;, and &quot;Oh My God&quot;. Also, &quot;Mr. Brownstone&quot; was dropped, when it was released in some areas as a double A-side to &quot;It's So Easy&quot; or &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot;.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Greatest Hits is a compilation album by the American rock band Guns N' Roses, released on March 23, 2004.
