The success of the tour was fueled by the crowd- pleasing songs, such as &quot;Thunderstruck&quot;, &quot;Moneytalks&quot;, &quot;Fire Your Guns&quot;, &quot;The Razors Edge&quot;, and &quot;Are You Ready&quot;, which were also included on the AC/DC Live Collector's Edition album. During this tour, three fans were crushed to death before a concert in Salt Lake City, an incident which Malcolm Young still does not talk about.\n \n During the Australian leg of the tour, the band were supported by the controversial Sydney band Candy Harlots. Members of AC/DC were extremely impressed with the band's performance, despite the fact that it was only their fifteenth show since the then new singer Aiz Lynch had joined.\n \n Singles\n Year Single Chart Position \n 1990 &quot;Thunderstruck&quot; Mainstream Rock 5 \n 1991 &quot;Moneytalks&quot; Billboard Hot 100 23 \n 1991 &quot;Are You Ready&quot; Mainstream Rock 16 \n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "The Razors Edge is an album by AC/DC, released on September 21, 1990.
