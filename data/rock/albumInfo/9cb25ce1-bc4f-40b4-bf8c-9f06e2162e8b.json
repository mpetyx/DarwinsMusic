{"album": {"wiki": {"content": "Fallen is the first full-length album by American alternative metal band Evanescence. It was released on the Wind-up Records label, and was their first album to be released worldwide. The album has sold over fifteen million copies worldwide and is the band's most successful album to date.\n \n Amy Lee said in an interview in Australia MTV's The Lair, that she never wrote together with Ben; she always started on her own, then presented her ideas to Ben and did arrangements. However, they were Amy's feelings that inspired many songs on Fallen. &quot;Going Under&quot; is about a previous emotionally and physically damaging relationship. This was the last song written for Fallen and would have been the first single had &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; not been put onto the Daredevil soundtrack. It became the second single.\n \n &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot;, also written by Amy Lee, is inspired by an incident that occurred while she was sitting in a restaurant. Lee has also recently stated that the song was written about her old friend, and now husband, Josh. Amy's sister, Carrie Lee had a fascination with pop stars such as Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, and it was the inspiration for &quot;Everybody's Fool&quot;. Amy Lee said that Carrie, 8 at the time, started to dress as those two superstars and that it angered Amy.\n \n &quot;My Immortal&quot; was written by Evanescence's former guitarist, Ben Moody, with Amy Lee adding the bridge. Like all songs written by Moody, the lyrics are based on a short story he wrote. According to Moody, the song is about a spirit staying with you after its death and haunting you until you actually wish that the spirit were gone because it won't leave you alone. Ben also stated in the Fallen booklet that he dedicated the song to Bill Holcomb, his grandfather.\n \n &quot;Haunted&quot; is based on a story written by Ben Moody that served as an inspiration for Amy Lee to write the lyrics. The story is about a little girl that gets trapped in a mansion that turns into a decaying mess. This story was posted by Moody at EvBoard.com.\n \n &quot;Hello&quot; is written in memory of Amy Lee's sister, as is &quot;Like You&quot; on The Open Door. As of November 2008, neither song has ever been performed live by the band.\n \n &quot;Tourniquet&quot;, written by Rocky Gray for his band Soul Embraced, is a song coming from a Christian standpoint, but it's about suicide. It is from the perspective of someone who has just committed suicide.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Fallen is the first full-length album by American alternative metal band Evanescence.
