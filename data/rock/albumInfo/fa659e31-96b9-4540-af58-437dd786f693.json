{"album": {"wiki": {"content": "Back in Black is the 7th studio album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, released on 25 July 1980. Back in Black was the first AC/DC album recorded without former lead singer Bon Scott, who had died at the age of 33 on February 19, 1980. The band considered disbanding following Scott's death, but ultimately decided to continue and shortly thereafter hired Brian Johnson as their new lead singer and lyricist. Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange, who had previously worked with AC/DC on Highway to Hell, was again brought in to produce.\n \n The album was remastered and re-released first in late 1994, then again in the Bonfire box set in 1997, and as part of the AC/DC Remasters Series in 2003. In addition, a Dualdisc version was released in 2004, featuring the album in enhanced LPCM Stereo format and the video documentary The Story of Back in Black.\n \n On December 13th 2007, the RIAA certified it 22.00\u00d7 Multi Platinum, recognising 22 million shipments throughout the United States &amp; worldwide has sold an estimated 42 million copies - making it second only to Michael Jackson's Thriller as the best-selling album of all-time.\n \n \n Overview\n Back in Black contains some of AC/DC's biggest hits, including &quot;Hells Bells&quot;, &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot;, and the title track &quot;Back in Black.&quot; According to Angus Young the album's all-black cover was a &quot;sign of mourning&quot; for Scott, as black is the traditional Western colour of mourning. It is AC/DC's best selling album, the second best-selling album of all time, and the biggest selling album by any band, with more than 42 million copies sold worldwide.[3] In 2006 Back in Black was certified by the Recording Industry Association of America as the fifth best-selling album in the United States, with 22 million copies sold.[4] Despite its massive commercial success, it is not AC/DC's highest charting album in the U.S, peaking at #4; their next album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You, hit #1 in 1981.[5]\n \n In 1989, it was ranked #26 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 100 Greatest Albums of the 80's. In 2003, the album was ranked number 73 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.[6] VH1 named 'Back in Black' as one of the biggest comeback albums of all time.\n \n \n  Track listing\n &quot;Hells Bells&quot; \u2013 5:12 \n &quot;Shoot To Thrill&quot; \u2013 5:17 \n &quot;What Do You Do for Money Honey&quot; \u2013 3:35 \n &quot;Givin' the Dog a Bone&quot; \u2013 3:32 \n &quot;Let Me Put My Love into You&quot; \u2013 4:15 \n &quot;Back in Black&quot; \u2013 4:15 \n &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot; \u2013 3:30 \n &quot;Have a Drink on Me&quot; \u2013 3:59 \n &quot;Shake a Leg&quot; \u2013 4:06 \n &quot;Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution&quot; \u2013 4:15 \n All songs written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young, and Brian Johnson. \n It should be noted that &quot;Givin' The Dog A Bone&quot; was originally spelled &quot;Given The Dog A Bone.&quot;\n \n \n Personnel\n Brian Johnson \u2014 lead vocals \n Angus Young \u2014 lead guitar \n Malcolm Young \u2014 rhythm guitar, backing vocals \n Cliff Williams \u2014 bass guitar, backing vocals \n Phil Rudd \u2014 drums \n \n Production\n Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange \u2014 Producer \n Benji Armbrister \u2014 Assistant Engineer \n Bob Defrin \u2014 Art Direction \n Robert Ellis \u2014 Photography \n Bob Ludwig \u2014 Mastering (original LP) \n Barry Diament \u2014 Mastering (original CD releases) \n Ted Jensen \u2014 Remastering (EMI/Atco reissue) \n George Marino \u2014 Remastering (Epic reissue) \n Tony Platt \u2014 Engineer \n Brad Samuelsohn \u2014 Mixing \n Jack Newber \u2014 Assistant Engineer \n \n \n \n Year Chart Position \n 1980 UK Albums Chart #1 \n 1981 Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart #1 \n 1980 Billboard Pop Albums #3 \n 1980 \u00d63 Austria Top 40 #2 \n 1980 Norwegian Album Charts #11 \n 1980 RIANZ Album Top 50 #1 \n 1990 The Billboard 200 #13 \n 2008 Billboard Top Pop Catalog #1 \n \n \n \n Year Single Chart Position \n 1980 &quot;Rock And Roll Ain't Noise Pollution&quot; UK Singles Chart #15 \n 1980 &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot; Billboard Hot 100 #35 \n 1981 &quot;Back in Black&quot; Billboard Hot 100 #37 \n 1980 &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot; UK Singles Chart #38 \n 1981 &quot;Hells Bells&quot; Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks #4 \n 1981 &quot;Back in Black&quot; Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks #1 \n 1981 &quot;Shoot To Thrill&quot; Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks #18 \n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Back in Black is the 7th studio album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, released on 25 July 1980.
