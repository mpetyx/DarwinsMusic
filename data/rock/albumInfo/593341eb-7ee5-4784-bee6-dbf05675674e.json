{"album": {"wiki": {"content": " Hell Freezes Over is a live album by the Eagles, released in 1994. The album contains four new studio tracks and eleven tracks recorded live for an MTV special. It went to #1 on the Billboard album chart upon its release where it stayed for two weeks. It is the band's second live album behind their live album in 1980. The Eagles had gotten back together after a 14-year-long break up. Their resumption tour would be given that title after the statement Henley once gave when asked when the band would get back together. The album proved to be as successful as the tour, selling over six million copies and releasing two Top 40 singles in &quot;Get Over It&quot; and &quot;Love Will Keep Us Alive&quot;. The band's lineup consisted of the Long Run era, Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Joe Walsh, Don Felder, and Timothy Schmit. The tour would last from 1994 to 1996 and became one of the most successful tours in music history. The album also features an acoustic version of &quot;Hotel California&quot;. Hell Freezes Over was also released in video form on VHS, LaserDisc and DVD.\n \n Background:\n The album name is in reference to a quote by Don Henley after the band's breakup in 1980; he commented that the band would play together again &quot;when Hell freezes over.&quot; One of the most notable tracks is a new arrangement of &quot;Hotel California&quot; that features an extended acoustic guitar and percussion opening. At the beginning of the concert, Glenn Frey joked to the audience: &quot;For the record, we never broke up; we just took a 14-year vacation.&quot;\n The new song &quot;Get Over It&quot; became a modest hit, and another new song, &quot;Love Will Keep Us Alive&quot;, reached #1 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart.\n The DVD is one of the first music releases to feature a DTS format soundtrack in addition to a PCM stereo soundtrack. The DVD also featured the song &quot;Seven Bridges Road&quot; in DTS audio only. The DVD has since been re-released with an additional Dolby Digital soundtrack. The album has also been released as DTS CD in 1997.\n \n Track listing:\n &quot;Get Over It&quot;* (Don Henley, Glenn Frey) \u2013 3:31\n &quot;Love Will Keep Us Alive&quot;* (Pete Vale, Jim Capaldi, Paul Carrack) \u2013 4:03\n &quot;The Girl from Yesterday&quot;* (Frey, Jack Tempchin) \u2013 3:23\n &quot;Learn to Be Still&quot;* (Henley, Stan Lynch) \u2013 4:28\n &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot; (Henley, Frey) \u2013 3:28\n &quot;Hotel California&quot; (Don Felder, Henley, Frey) \u2013 7:12\n &quot;Wasted Time&quot; (Henley, Frey) \u2013 5:19\n &quot;Pretty Maids All in a Row&quot; (Joe Walsh, Joe Vitale) \u2013 4:26\n &quot;I Can't Tell You Why&quot; (Henley, Frey, Schmit) \u2013 5:11\n &quot;New York Minute&quot; (Henley, Danny &quot;Kootch&quot; Kortchmar, Jai Winding) \u2013 6:37\n &quot;The Last Resort&quot; (Henley, Frey) \u2013 7:24\n &quot;Take It Easy&quot; (Jackson Browne, Frey) \u2013 4:36\n &quot;In the City&quot; (Walsh, Barry De Vorzon) \u2013 4:07\n &quot;Life in the Fast Lane&quot; (Henley, Frey, Walsh) \u2013 6:01\n &quot;Desperado&quot; (Henley, Frey) \u2013 4:17\n *All new songs were released as studio recordings on the album, but can be seen live on the VHS and DVD versions.\n \n DVD-only tracks\n &quot;Help Me Through The Night&quot; (Walsh)\n &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot; (Henley, Mike Campbell, J.D.
