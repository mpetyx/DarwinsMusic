{"album": {"wiki": {"content": "Boxer is the fourth full-length studio album by Brooklyn-via-Cincinnati indie rock band The National. It was released on May 22, 2007 by Beggars Banquet Records. The album features a guest performance by Sufjan Stevens on &quot;Ada&quot; and &quot;Racing Like a Pro&quot; and backing vocals by Marla Hansen. It debuted at number 68 on the U.S. Billboard 200, selling about 9,500 copies in its first week. The song &quot;Slow Show&quot; contains lyrics from the band's song &quot;29 Years,&quot; first found on their self-titled debut album.\n \n &quot;From the first piano chords on opener &quot;Fake Empire&quot;, the National create a late-night, empty-city-street mood, slightly menacing but mostly isolated. The 10 tracks that follow sustain and even amplify that feeling, revealing the band's range as they play close to the vest.&quot; So says Pitchfork Media's Steven Deusner, who gave the album an 8.6/10.0. The album also received 4 stars from Rolling Stone's Rob Sheffield.\n \n Songs from Boxer have made appearances on television shows such as &quot;Chuck&quot; &quot;The Riches&quot; &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; and President Barack Obama's campaign video &quot;Signs of Hope and Change&quot;\n \n A film by Vincent Moon documenting the creation of the album, entitled &quot;A Skin, a Night&quot; was released on Beggar's Banquet on May 20, 2008.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Boxer is the fourth full-length studio album by Brooklyn-via-Cincinnati indie rock band The National.
