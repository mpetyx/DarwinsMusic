{"album": {"wiki": {"content": "Meteora is the second studio album by American rock band Linkin Park, released on March 25, 2003. Following the collaboration album Reanimation which featured remixes of their debut album Hybrid Theory. Linkin Park released singles from Meteora for over a year, including &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot;, &quot;Faint&quot;, &quot;Lying from You&quot;, &quot;From the Inside&quot;, &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; and &quot;Numb&quot;.\n \n It is the most successful album in the history of the Modern Rock Tracks chart, a chart that specializes in radio play of alternative rock songs. &quot;Numb&quot; was the biggest song of the year on the chart. The album has sold over 5 million copies in the United States, and over 16 million worldwide to date.\n \n The album was named after the Meteora rock formation in Greece. After seeing these monasteries on a trip to Europe, the band was inspired by the way they were built, almost defying gravity. It was this feeling of greatness and awesome accomplishment that Linkin Park wished to convey with their music, thus the name.\n \n Don Gilmore co-produced the album. Linkin Park comprehensively rehearsed the album, recording more than 40 choruses for the first single &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot;. Like the band's first full-length Hybrid Theory, Meteora was recorded using multitrack recording methods in which each instrument is recorded individually rather than played all at once, as is done in a typical studio setting. In its first week it sold an estimated 810,000 units. To date, it has well over 4 million copies in the U.S. alone, nearly 16 million copies worldwide.\n \n The music in Meteora represents significant changes since the release of Hybrid Theory. It is characterized by more relevant influences from rap metal (&quot;Lying from You&quot;, &quot;Hit the Floor&quot;, &quot;Faint&quot;, &quot;Figure.09&quot;, &quot;Nobody's Listening&quot;). Their instrumental song &quot;Session&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 2003. &quot;Nobody's Listening&quot; featured a small sample from the band's track, &quot;High Voltage&quot;, which appeared on the B-side of One Step Closer and the bonus disc of Hybrid Theory. The sample was a distorted version of Mike rapping, &quot;Coming at you from every side&quot; which comes from the chorus of High Voltage.\n \n The instrumental track &quot;Session&quot; was featured on the soundtrack of the 2003 movie The Matrix Reloaded and on the Season Five Sopranos episode &quot;In Camelot&quot;.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Meteora is the second studio album by American rock band Linkin Park, released on March 25, 2003.
