{"album": {"wiki": {"content": "<a title=\"Foo Fighters - There Is Nothing Left to Lose\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/There+Is+Nothing+Left+to+Lose\" class=\"bbcode_album\">There Is Nothing Left to Lose</a> is the third album by the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Foo Fighters</a>, released in <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/1999\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">1999</a>, following the band's biggest seller <a title=\"Foo Fighters - The Colour and the Shape\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/The+Colour+and+the+Shape\" class=\"bbcode_album\">The Colour and the Shape</a>. Their first release on the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/label/bmg\" class=\"bbcode_label\">bmg</a> label, the album debuted and peaked at #10 both in the US and UK, and broadened their fanbase further with such hits as <a title=\"Foo Fighters &ndash; Learn to Fly\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Learn+to+Fly\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Learn to Fly</a>, <a title=\"Foo Fighters &ndash; Stacked Actors\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Stacked+Actors\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Stacked Actors</a>, <a title=\"Foo Fighters &ndash; Breakout\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Breakout\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Breakout</a> and <a title=\"Foo Fighters &ndash; Next Year\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Next+Year\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Next Year</a>. Many of the songs stray from the band's first two albums because they have a mildly experimental feel. The album is also more radio-friendly, with less abrasive vocals and less angry and aggressive songs than other Foo Fighters albums.\n \n It was the first album recorded with permanent drummer <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Hawkins\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Taylor Hawkins</a>, and last album to not feature permanent guitarist <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Shiflett\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Chris Shiflett</a>, who replaced former guitarist <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Franz+Stahl\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Franz Stahl</a>. Stahl departed the band just prior to the album's recording due to creative differences, wanting to play harder edged songs like the previous albums featured. Since There Is Nothing Left to Lose, the Foo Fighters have held up the same line-up of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Grohl\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Dave Grohl</a>, Shiflett, Hawkins, and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nate+Mendel\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Nate Mendel</a>.\n \n Early pressings of the disc included a temporary tattoo, similar to the one featured on the album cover. The album was also re-released in <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/2001\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">2001</a> as a two-CD edition which offers a second VCD disc of four videos and one bonus track, <a title=\"Foo Fighters &ndash; Fraternity\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Fraternity\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Fraternity</a>. This edition has a picture of the Australian swimmer Michael Klim on the front, chosen because he has a Foo Fighters tattoo on his left shoulder, and has also admitted to be a Foo Fighters fan several times.\n \n Singer/guitarist Dave Grohl has stated before that the album was recorded at his home and that the band would have &quot;a BBQ every day after recording.&quot;\n \n This album was the first Foo Fighters album to have a song reach the top of the Modern Rock Tracks chart, with <a title=\"Foo Fighters &ndash; Learn to Fly\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/_/Learn+to+Fly\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Learn to Fly</a>. It started a pattern of every Foo Fighters album having more weeks at the top of the chart than the one before it (<a title=\"Foo Fighters - There Is Nothing Left to Lose\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/There+Is+Nothing+Left+to+Lose\" class=\"bbcode_album\">There Is Nothing Left to Lose</a> - 1 week; <a title=\"Foo Fighters - One by One\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/One+by+One\" class=\"bbcode_album\">One by One</a> - 10 weeks; <a title=\"Foo Fighters - In Your Honor\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/In+Your+Honor\" class=\"bbcode_album\">In Your Honor</a> - 13 weeks; <a title=\"Foo Fighters - Echoes, Silence, Patience and Grace\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/Echoes,+Silence,+Patience+and+Grace\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Echoes, Silence, Patience and Grace</a> - 25 weeks).\n \n The album is widely available as an &quot;Enhanced CD&quot;.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "<a title=\"Foo Fighters - There Is Nothing Left to Lose\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/There+Is+Nothing+Left+to+Lose\" class=\"bbcode_album\">There Is Nothing Left to Lose</a> is the third album by the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Foo Fighters</a>, released in <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/1999\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">1999</a>, following the band's biggest seller <a title=\"Foo Fighters - The Colour and the Shape\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/The+Colour+and+the+Shape\" class=\"bbcode_album\">The Colour and the Shape</a>.
