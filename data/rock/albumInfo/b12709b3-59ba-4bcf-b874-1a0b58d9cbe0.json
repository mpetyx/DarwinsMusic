{"album": {"wiki": {"content": "Just Push Play is the thirteenth studio album by American hard rock band Aerosmith, released in 2001 (see 2001 in music). Helping Aerosmith in the studio were coproducers and song collaborators Marti Frederiksen and Mark Hudson.\n \n Just Push Play features the same slick pop production that Aerosmith had been using in recent albums, though this time there was more of a vintage-era edge to most of the tracks.\n \n The album's first single, &quot;Jaded&quot;, became a major Top 10 hit in the U.S. and around the world. As a result, Just Push Play was certified platinum within a month of its release. Subsequent singles &quot;Fly Away from Here&quot;, &quot;Sunshine&quot;, and &quot;Just Push Play&quot;, though garnering some airplay, failed to impact the Hot 100 much, although the latter two charted on the U.S. Mainstream Rock chart and the former charted on the Adult Top 40.\n \n The eight-month long Just Push Play Tour, which ran from June 2001 to January 2002 was launched to support the album.\n \n The album's cover features a gynoid resembling Marilyn Monroe and was designed by Hajime Sorayama. As a pun of the album name, Guitar Hero: Aerosmith uses the album's cover on the start screen and states over it &quot;Just push any button to play&quot;. The cover is similar to American rock band Autograph's album That's the Stuff because they both have gynoids on the cover.\n \n Track listing\n # Title Music Length \n 1. &quot;Beyond Beautiful&quot;   Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, Marti Frederiksen, Mark Hudson 4:45 \n 2. &quot;Just Push Play&quot;   Tyler, Hudson, Steve Dudas 3:51 \n 3. &quot;Jaded&quot;   Tyler, Fredriksen 3:34 \n 4. &quot;Fly Away from Here&quot;   Fredriksen, Todd Chapman 5:01 \n 5. &quot;Trip Hoppin'&quot;   Tyler, Perry, Fredriksen, Hudson 4:27 \n 6. &quot;Sunshine&quot;   Tyler, Perry, Fredriksen 3:37 \n 7. &quot;Under My Skin&quot;   Tyler, Perry, Fredriksen, Hudson 3:45 \n 8. &quot;Luv Lies&quot;   Tyler, Perry, Fredriksen, Hudson 4:26 \n 9. &quot;Outta Your Head&quot;   Tyler, Perry, Fredriksen 3:22 \n 10. &quot;Drop Dead Gorgeous&quot;   Tyler, Perry, Hudson 3:42 \n 11. &quot;Light Inside&quot;   Tyler, Perry, Fredriksen 3:34 \n 12. &quot;Avant Garden&quot;   Tyler, Perry, Fredriksen, Hudson 4:52 \n \n Roughly 45 seconds after &quot;Avant Garden&quot; a hidden track entitled &quot;Under My Skin Reprise&quot; plays for about one minute. \n \n Bonus track and video (International version)\n A bonus track and video was included on limited edition North American releases exclusive to Best Buy.\n \n # Title Music Length \n 13. &quot;Face&quot;   Tyler, Perry, Fredriksen 4:25 \n 14. &quot;Jaded&quot; (video)   3:47 \n \n \n Bonus tracks (Japanese version)\n # Title Length \n 13. &quot;Won't Let You Down&quot;     \n 14. &quot;I Don't Want to Miss a Thing&quot;     \n \n \n  Disc 2 (Japanese limited edition)\n &quot;Just Push Play&quot; [Radio Remix] - 3:17 \n &quot;Same Old Song and Dance&quot; [Live from California Jam II '78] - 5:14 \n &quot;Draw the Line&quot; [Live from California Jam II '78] - 4:32 \n &quot;Chip Away the Stone&quot; [Live from California Jam II '78] - 4:24 \n &quot;Big Ten Inch Record&quot; [Live from Texxas Jam '78] - 3:59 \n &quot;Lord of the Thighs&quot; [Live from Texxas Jam '78] - 7:14 \n \n Personnel\n Tom Hamilton - bass \n Joey Kramer - drums \n Joe Perry - guitar, Background vocals \n Steven Tyler - lead vocals, harmonica, percussion, piano, squeezebox, additional guitar, drums \n Brad Whitford - guitar \n \n Additional personnel\n Paul Caruso - loop programming \n Jim Cox - piano \n Dan Higgins - clarinet, saxophone \n Tony Perry - guitar, scratching, pedal steel, vocals, background vocals, hurdygurdy, slide guitar \n Paul Santo - Hammond organ, Kurzweil synthesizer \n Tower of Power - horn \n Liv Tyler - whisper \n Chelsea Tyler - Backing vocals (Under My Skin) \n \n Production\n Producers: Marti Frederiksen, Mark Hudson, Joe Perry, Steven Tyler \n Engineers: Brian Carrigan, Paul Caruso, Richard Chycki, Marti Frederiksen, Scott Gordon, Jesse Henderson, Paul Santo, Allen Sides \n Assistant engineer: Fran Flannery \n Mixing: Mike Shipley \n Mastering: George Marino \n Recording: Richard Chycki, Marti Frederiksen \n Instrument technician: Jim Survis \n Loop programming: Paul Caruso \n Horn arrangements: Jim Cox \n String arrangements: David Campbell, Jim Cox \n Special projects coordinator: Keith Garde \n Author: Stephen Saper \n Art direction: Kevin Reagan \n Design: Kevin Reagan \n Make-up: Melissa Rogers \n \n [edit] Charts\n \n Album\n Billboard (North America)\n \n Year Chart Position \n 2001 The Billboard 200 2 \n 2001 Top Canadian Albums 2 \n 2001 Top Internet Albums 2 \n \n \n Singles\n Billboard (North America)\n \n Year Single Chart Position \n 2001 &quot;Fly Away from Here&quot; Adult Top 40 36 \n 2001 &quot;Fly Away from Here&quot; Top 40 Mainstream 24 \n 2001 &quot;Fly Away from Here&quot; Top 40 Tracks 34 \n 2001 &quot;Jaded&quot; Adult Top 40 6 \n 2001 &quot;Jaded&quot; Canadian Singles Chart 6 \n 2001 &quot;Jaded&quot; Latin Pop Airplay 30 \n 2001 &quot;Jaded&quot; Latin Tropical/Salsa Airplay 21 \n 2001 &quot;Jaded&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks 1 \n 2001 &quot;Jaded&quot; The Billboard Hot 100 7 \n 2001 &quot;Jaded&quot; Adult Top 40 Recurrents 6 \n 2001 &quot;Jaded&quot; Top 40 Mainstream 6 \n 2001 &quot;Jaded&quot; Top 40 Tracks 8 \n 2001 &quot;Just Push Play&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks 10 \n 2001 &quot;Sunshine&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks 23 \n 2002 &quot;Just Push Play&quot; Top 40 Mainstream 38 \n \n \n Certifications\n Organization Level Date \n RIAA - USA Gold April 3, 2001 \n RIAA - USA Platinum April 3, 2001 \n ABPD - Brazil Gold 2001 \n \n \n A promotional Just Push Play poster can be seen in Drake and Josh's room in the Teen Nick show &quot;Drake and Josh&quot;. \n Joe Perry provides lead vocals on the track &quot;Drop Dead Gorgeous&quot;. \n &quot;Beyond Beautiful&quot; is a playable song in Guitar Hero: Aerosmith. \n A tribute to the title song of the album can be seen in the Disney's Hollywood Studios' attraction Rock 'n' Roller Coaster.
