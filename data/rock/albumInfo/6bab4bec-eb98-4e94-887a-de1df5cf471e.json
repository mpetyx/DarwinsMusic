{"album": {"wiki": {"content": "Vices &amp; Virtues is the third studio album by American rock band Panic! at the Disco, released on March 22, 2011 on Fueled by Ramen. Produced by John Feldmann and Butch Walker, the album was recorded as a duo by vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Brendon Urie and drummer Spencer Smith, following the departure of primary lyricist and guitarist Ryan Ross and bassist Jon Walker in July 2009.\n While Walker and Ross' exit left a hole in the Panic! songwriting regime, the experience became the catalyst for Urie finding his own voice and the confidence to take over as the band's principal songsmith. The lyrics touch on themes of manipulation and confusion. Vices &amp; Virtues took over two years to create, and the increased time in the studio brought forth new musical experimentation.\n Upon release, the album received generally mixed to positive reviews. Critics praised the album's wide variety of musical stylings, while citing compositional simplicity and Urie's verbose lyricism as detractors. Preceded by lead single, &quot;The Ballad of Mona Lisa&quot;, the album debuted at number seven on the Billboard 200 selling 56,000 copies within its first week.\n \n Vices &amp; Virtues has received mixed to positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 62 out of 100, which indicates &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot; based on 15 reviews. Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post called the record &quot;one of 2011's best and most captivating albums,&quot; calling &quot;Sarah Smiles&quot; the &quot;stand-out&quot; and noting the wise change in tone to high-energy with the second track, &quot;Let's Kill Tonight&quot;. Alternative Press also welcomed the new version of Panic! at the Disco. &quot;Perhaps Smith and Urie's biggest success on Vices is their disinterest in simply recreating either of their previous albums, instead choosing to meld the youthful exuberance of their debut with the restraint and maturity of 2008's Pretty. Odd.,&quot; wrote critic Evan Lucy. &quot;The duo sound absolutely recharged, likely a result of the lineup shuffling, but also perhaps a realization that the '70s were a nice place to visit for a couple years, but life in the 21st century is much more fun.&quot; He went on to praise the &quot;Elfman-esque string arrangements, creepy undertones and twinkling pianos&quot; on several tracks and enjoy the &quot;scaled-back,&quot; more personal tracks, such as &quot;The Calendar&quot; and &quot;Memories&quot;. James Montgomery of MTV News said of the album, &quot;Vices is at its very core a studio album, one stuffed with ideas and instrumentation, which not only positions Panic! as perhaps this generation's Brian-Wilsons-on-a-budget, but serves as a solid starting point for wherever Urie and Smith choose to go from here.&quot; He complimented the new sound of the band: &quot;It's not exactly new, not exactly old, but it's definitely something. Call it a fresh start, a return to form, a re-imaging of the past, just don't call it Pretty. Odd. because that ship has sailed. Panic! are back to their old tricks, exclamation point and all ... and perhaps that was the secret ingredient all along.&quot;\n \n Negative criticism for the album mostly came regarding the inexperienced lyrcism of Urie. William Goodman of Spin criticized Urie's lyrics of the album (&quot;the result is verbose and generic diary-entry romance&quot;) but praised the musical experimentation, remarking, &quot;Vices &amp; Virtues's saving grace, though, is the varied instrumentation \u2014 marimbas, xylophones, accordion, synths, and digital atmospherics.&quot; Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone concurred with Goodman and also focused positive opinion upon the arrangements of the album, recommending &quot;Nearly Witches&quot; and calling the album &quot;emo retropop&quot;, commenting, &quot;It's the closest emo has come to the sound of old-school pop and rock, with Beach Boys harmonies and even gypsy-style swing flavoring the usual hopped-up confessions.&quot; Entertainment Weekly agreed with these sentiments, giving the album a B- and recommending &quot;The Ballad of Mona-Lisa&quot; and the &quot;harmony-drenched&quot; &quot;Sarah Smiles&quot;.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Vices &amp; Virtues is the third studio album by American rock band Panic! at the Disco, released on March 22, 2011 on Fueled by Ramen.
