It is their first album since First Impressions of Earth (2006), their longest gap to date between studio albums.\n \n Angles entered the Australian albums chart at #1, The Strokes' first time at the top spot within the country and the second time such a feat has occurred thus far in the band's career. Meanwhile, it reached #4 in the US with an entry sales week of 89,000 units, 1,000 more than that of its predecessor, First Impressions of Earth.\n \n Inspired, in part, by bands like Arctic Monkeys, and Crystal Castles, The Strokes decided to experiment with various production techniques including MIDI electronic samples and Farfisa keyboards. They also overdubbed more guitars, and Casablancas toyed with vocal layers. Bassist Nikolai Fraiture revealed that the album would be &quot;a return to the basics&quot;, suggesting the songs would be of similar style to their acclaimed 2001 debut record, Is This It. &quot;Sonically, I feel it's the album which should have been made between Room on Fire and First Impressions of Earth,&quot; he stated.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Angles is the fourth studio album by American indie rock band The Strokes, released on March 18, 2011.
