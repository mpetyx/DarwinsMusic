In January 2006, the band then made their second appearance on Saturday Night Live playing &quot;Juicebox&quot; and &quot;You Only Live Once&quot;.\n The album was somewhat a departure from the band's two previous albums. One reason for this was a switch of producers from Gordon Raphael to David Kahne. Despite its initial strong sales, First Impressions of Earth received the worst reception, both commercially and critically, of all their three albums.\n In 2006, the band played 18 sold-out shows during their UK tour. In February 2006, The Strokes won &quot;Best International Band&quot; at the NME Awards. In March, the band returned to the US with their longest tour yet. The second single off First Impressions of Earth, &quot;Heart in a Cage&quot;, was released in March 2006.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Their third album, First Impressions of Earth, was released in January 2006 to mixed reviews and debuted at number four in the US and number one in the UK, a first for the band.
