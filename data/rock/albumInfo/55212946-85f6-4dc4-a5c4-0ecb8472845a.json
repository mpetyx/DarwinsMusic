{"album": {"wiki": {"content": "Sam's Town is the second studio album by Las Vegas rock band The Killers, released on October 2, 2006 in the United Kingdom and the following day in the United States. The album is said to be influenced by the works of U2, Bruce Springsteen and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, among others. Sam's Town received mixed reviews, with some praising The Killers' new direction and others criticising it.\n \n The album takes its name from Sam's Town Hotel and Gambling Hall, a hotel-casino in Las Vegas, the hometown of the band. The bikini-clad woman on the cover of Sam's Town is model and singer Felice LaZae. The album's co-producer Flood is dressed as a Native American in the CD booklet. The artwork inside the album booklet is taken from a downtown-Las Vegas mural painted by Suzanne Hackett-Morgan, a local painter.\n \n In the US, the album opened at #2, selling 315,000 in its first week. The album went straight to #1 in the UK selling over 260,000 in a week. As of March 2007, the album has sold about 2,750,000 copies worldwide. The album has been certified 2x Platinum in Canada. As of July 11, 2007, it has sold 1,205,621 copies in the US. A late surge in sales in the United Kingdom and a continued flow of international sales means that Sam's Town is fast approaching Hot Fuss with almost 4 million sales worldwide to date. The album has sold over 1,200,000 copies in the UK.\n \n In the 2007 Chris Rock movie I Think I Love My Wife, Richard Cooper supposedly picks up Sam's Town while in a music store. Also, when Cooper begins to speak with Nelson, a poster of an NME magazine cover can be seen in the background with all four members of the band on it.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Sam's Town is the second studio album by Las Vegas rock band The Killers, released on October 2, 2006 in the United Kingdom and the following day in the United States.
