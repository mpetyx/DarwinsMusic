{"album": {"wiki": {"content": "<a title=\"U2 - Achtung Baby\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/Achtung+Baby\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Achtung Baby</a> is the seventh studio album by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/irish\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">irish</a> <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/rock\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">rock</a> band <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">U2</a>, released on 19 November <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/1991\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">1991</a>. The album arrived nearly two years after lead vocalist <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bono\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Bono</a> announced the band would have to &quot;go away and dream it all up again&quot;, following the mixed response to <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/1988\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">1988</a>'s <a title=\"U2 - Rattle And Hum\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/Rattle+And+Hum\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Rattle And Hum</a>. While recording <em>Achtung Baby</em>, there was a rift between band members over the direction of the band's sound. Tensions almost prompted U2 to break-up until the band rallied around the writing of the album's hit <a title=\"U2 &ndash; One\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/One\" class=\"bbcode_track\">One</a>.\n \n The album marks a dramatic change in the band's image and sound, with the band being heavily influenced by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative%20rock\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">alternative rock</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/electronic\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">electronic</a> music. Their music also features more detailed production, more guitar effects, and darker, more personal lyrical content. The results were considerably more adventurous than their previous efforts, yet <em>Achtung Baby</em> was very commercially and critically successful, winning a Grammy Award and having sold approximately 18 million copies worldwide. In <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/2003\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">2003</a>, the album was ranked number 62 on <em>Rolling Stone</em> magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n \n The band embarked on the elaborately-staged, multimedia-intensive Zoo TV Tour to support the album.\n \n <strong>History</strong>\n <em>Achtung Baby</em> was a departure for the band. Bono has often described the album as &quot;the sound of four men trying to chop down The Joshua Tree&quot;. U2 sampled techniques and sounds from other musical genres previously unused by the band, including <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/dance\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">dance</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/house\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">house</a> and electronica, whilst maintaining their original feel of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/rock%20and%20roll\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">rock and roll</a>.\n \n The album's new sound was a source of conflict in the band because <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Edge\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Edge</a> and Bono favored the new sounds they were coming up with while recording their sessions in <span title=\"Unknown place\" class=\"bbcode_unknown\">Berlin</span>, while drummer <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Larry+Mullen+Jr.\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Larry Mullen Jr.</a> and bassist <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Adam+Clayton\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Adam Clayton</a> were partial to the band's traditional sound. The conflict amongst the members of U2 very nearly led to the band breaking up, but the fighting subdued after The Edge, struggling with two bridge sections for the song <a title=\"U2 &ndash; Ultraviolet (Light My Way)\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/Ultraviolet+(Light+My+Way)\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Ultraviolet (Light My Way)</a> was encouraged to combine them by the band and producers <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Eno\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Brian Eno</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Daniel+Lanois\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Daniel Lanois</a>. The band rallied around the riff and was inspired to write the song <em>One</em>. It changed the band's outlook on the album, helping bring them back from the brink during recording sessions. <em>One</em> was responsible for a renewed sense of optimism towards the material they had already recorded. Leaving Berlin on a high note, the band was able to complete the rest of the album in <span title=\"Unknown place\" class=\"bbcode_unknown\">Dublin</span>.\n \n <em>Achtung Baby</em> was also darker sounding than previous efforts, thanks in large part to songs such as <a title=\"U2 &ndash; The Fly\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/The+Fly\" class=\"bbcode_track\">The Fly</a>, <a title=\"U2 &ndash; Acrobat\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/Acrobat\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Acrobat</a>, and <a title=\"U2 &ndash; Love Is Blindness\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/Love+Is+Blindness\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Love Is Blindness</a>, which deal with themes of helplessness, broken relationships, and (in the case of <em>Love Is Blindness</em>) violence in the name of love. The spiritual yearning of U2's <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/1980s\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">1980s</a> work began to take on a more existential, despairing element in <em>Achtung Baby</em>. The band's political activism moved to the AIDS crisis and environmental issues. At the same time, the band also took on a lighter tone, electing to use irony rather than earnestness in its music and public appearances, and poking fun at its own self-importance during the 1980s. This evolving outlook culminated in the pleaful soul-searching (and jaded skewering of contemporary life) on <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/1997\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">1997</a>'s <a title=\"U2 - Pop\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/Pop\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Pop</a> and would not subside until the more hopeful tracks on <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/2000\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">2000</a>'s <a title=\"U2 - All That You Can't Leave Behind\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/All+That+You+Can%27t+Leave+Behind\" class=\"bbcode_album\">All That You Can't Leave Behind</a>.\n \n Other tracks included the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/distorted\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">distorted</a> opener <a title=\"U2 &ndash; Zoo Station\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/Zoo+Station\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Zoo Station</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/danceable\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">danceable</a> single <a title=\"U2 &ndash; Even Better Than the Real Thing\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/Even+Better+Than+the+Real+Thing\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Even Better Than the Real Thing</a>, and the thumping rocker (and future live favourite) <a title=\"U2 &ndash; Until the End of the World\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/Until+the+End+of+the+World\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Until the End of the World</a>, written for the soundtrack of Wim Wenders' eponymous 1991 science fiction film. The song may be an allegorical afterlife confession of Judas Iscariot.\n \n <em>Achtung Baby</em> expanded the group's fanbase. New fans were perhaps drawn in by the hit song <a title=\"U2 &ndash; Mysterious Ways\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/Mysterious+Ways\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Mysterious Ways</a> and the ballad <em>One</em>.\n \n The album was followed by the Zoo TV Tour, a ground-breaking and, in Zoo TV: Live from Sydney, Grammy-award winning multimedia concert production.\n \n The U.S. LP is the only American release to contain the uncensored picture of bassist Adam Clayton naked. On the U.S. CD and cassette, his private parts are censored with a black &quot;X&quot; or a four-leaf clover.\n \n As for the album's title, &quot;Achtung, Baby!&quot; in German means &quot;Attention, baby!&quot; or &quot;Careful, baby!&quot; Frequently used by the band's engineers during the making of the album, the phrase came from the Mel Brooks film <em>The Producers</em>.\n \n <em>Achtung Baby</em> was the first of 9 albums to feature 3 songs to reach the top of the Modern Rock Tracks.\n \n <strong>Reception</strong>\n On the Billboard Music Charts (North America), <em>Achtung Baby</em> topped the Billboard 200 chart selling 295,000 copies in its first week. It won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. Rolling Stone magazine declared that U2 had &quot;proven that the same penchant for epic musical and verbal gestures that leads many artists to self-parody can, in more inspired hands, fuel the unforgettable fire that defines great rock &amp; roll.&quot;\n \n The album is frequently cited as one of the greatest in rock history. In <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/1998\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">1998</a> <em>Q</em> magazine readers voted <em>Achtung Baby</em> the 15th greatest album of all time; in <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/2001\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">2001</a> the TV network <em>VH1</em> placed it at number 65. Also in <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/2003\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">2003</a>, <em>Q</em> declared its third track, <em>One</em>, &quot;the greatest recorded song of all time&quot;. In 2003, the album was ranked number 62 on <em>Rolling Stone</em> magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. It was voted #11 on <em>Spin</em>'s &quot;Best Albums of the Last 25 Years&quot; list. In a <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/2007\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">2007</a> <em>VH1</em> countdown, <em>One</em> was named the #2 on its list of &quot;Songs of the 1990s&quot;. <em>Entertainment Weekly</em> named <em>Achtung Baby</em> the #3 album of the last 25 years.\n \n <strong>Studio bootlegs</strong>\n \n U2 entered the studio in late <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/1990\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">1990</a> and began recording the album before they had written any material, mainly improvising and developing ideas into songs. The more interesting ideas were preserved on working tapes. In April 1991, these tapes fell into the hands of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/bootleg\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">bootleg</a>gers, well before the album's November release date. The most widely circulated compilation of these tapes is the three-disc <a title=\"U2 - Salom&eacute;: the Axtung Beibi Outtakes\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/Salom%C3%A9:+the+Axtung+Beibi+Outtakes\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Salom&eacute;: the Axtung Beibi Outtakes</a>, released in February <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/1992\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">1992</a>. Another bootleg surfaced, entitled, <a title=\"U2 - The Achtung Sessions\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/The+Achtung+Sessions\" class=\"bbcode_album\">The Achtung Sessions</a> in <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/1993\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">1993</a>.\n \n Later that same year, another single disc bootleg of the tapes was distributed underground. Called [album artist=U2[Studio Session '91[/album], this single disc contained material of songs that were near completion. Most notably; <a title=\"U2 &ndash; Heaven and Hell\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/Heaven+and+Hell\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Heaven and Hell</a>, <a title=\"U2 &ndash; The Darkest Night\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/The+Darkest+Night\" class=\"bbcode_track\">The Darkest Night</a>, and <a title=\"U2 &ndash; Blow Your House Down\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/Blow+Your+House+Down\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Blow Your House Down</a>. Interestingly, none of the &quot;Salome&quot; mixes were included on this disc.\n \n Since these songs were leaked very early in the production process, they provide a rare insight into the band's songwriting process. On the same note, many of the ideas\u2014including eight different takes of the song &quot;Salom\u00e9&quot;\u2014were frustratingly undeveloped, so the bootleg remains a curiosity strictly for hardcore fans. Bono says, &quot;There were no undiscovered works of genius, unfortunately, it was more just gobbledy-gook.&quot;\n \n Some of the ideas were revisited\u2014there are, for instance, early instrumental versions of <a title=\"U2 &ndash; Even Better Than the Real Thing\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/Even+Better+Than+the+Real+Thing\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Even Better Than the Real Thing</a> and <a title=\"U2 &ndash; North And South Of The River\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/North+And+South+Of+The+River\" class=\"bbcode_track\">North And South Of The River</a> (the latter of which wouldn't be recorded by the band until <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/1997\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">1997</a>)\u2014and one song\u2014the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/b-side\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">b-side</a> <a title=\"U2 &ndash; Where Did It All Go Wrong?\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/Where+Did+It+All+Go+Wrong%3F\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Where Did It All Go Wrong?</a>\u2014was even officially released as a rough composite of the two takes available on the bootleg. There are also a handful of developed ideas that were wholly abandoned, such as <a title=\"U2 &ndash; She's Gonna Blow Your House Down\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/She%27s+Gonna+Blow+Your+House+Down\" class=\"bbcode_track\">She's Gonna Blow Your House Down</a>, a song the group had been working on since the <em>Rattle and Hum</em> days.\n \n <strong>Video</strong>\n Following the successful release of the album, U2 released <em>Achtung Baby: The Videos, The Cameos, and a Whole Lot of Interference from Zoo TV</em>, a VHS compilation of music videos from the album. The compilation featured nine videos, including three videos for both <em>One</em> and <em>Even Better than the Real Thing</em>. In between the videos were clips of &quot;interference&quot; \u2014 documentary footage, media clips, and other images, similar to what was shown at shows during the Zoo TV Tour. The videos for <a title=\"U2 &ndash; Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/Who%27s+Gonna+Ride+Your+Wild+Horses\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses</a> and <a title=\"U2 &ndash; Love Is Blindness\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/_/Love+Is+Blindness\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Love Is Blindness</a> were the only videos from the album not included on this release, as they were not released until after the compilation's release.\n \n <strong>Professional Reviews</strong>\n <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:br61mpe39f2o\" rel=\"nofollow\">AllMusic - \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</a>\n <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/u2/albums/album/116432/review/5941852/achtung_baby\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rolling Stone - \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606</a>\n <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/ae/music/packages/U2Fleetcenter/album_review_achtung_baby\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Boston Globe</a>\n <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,316330,00.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Entertainment Weekly</a>\n <a href=\"http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=u2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Trouser Press</a>\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "<a title=\"U2 - Achtung Baby\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/Achtung+Baby\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Achtung Baby</a> is the seventh studio album by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/irish\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">irish</a> <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/rock\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">rock</a> band <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">U2</a>, released on 19 November <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/1991\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">1991</a>.
