{"album": {"wiki": {"content": "In Rainbows is the seventh studio album by the English <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative%20rock\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">alternative rock</a> band Radiohead. It was first released on 10 October <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/2007\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">2007</a> as a <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/digital%20download\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">digital download</a>, followed by a standard CD release in most countries during the last week of 2007. The album was released in North America on 1 January 2008. In Rainbows was Radiohead's first release after the end of their contract with <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/label/EMI\" class=\"bbcode_label\">EMI</a> and the end of the longest gap between studio albums in their career.\n \n In Rainbows was recorded in London, Somerset, Wiltshire and Oxfordshire with producers Mark Stent and Nigel Godrich. Radiohead worked on the songs for more than two years, beginning in early 2005. In between recording, the band toured Europe and North America for three months in 2006. Radiohead used a wide variety of musical styles on the album, incorporating string arrangements and electronic music, pianos, celestes and the ondes Martenot, yet renewing their focus on guitars, drums and bass as lead instruments. The songwriting on In Rainbows was more personal than that of Radiohead's other work, with singer <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Thom+Yorke\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Thom Yorke</a> describing it as his attempt to write &quot;seduction songs&quot;.\n \n Days after announcing the album's completion, Radiohead released In Rainbows as a digital download that customers could order for whatever price they saw fit. The download's commercial success is unclear, as the band declined to publicise their Internet sales numbers. Upon its retail release, however, In Rainbows entered the United World Chart, UK Album Chart, and the U.S. Billboard 200 at number one. In Rainbows also earned widespread critical acclaim, and several publications ranked it as one of the best albums of 2007.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "In Rainbows is the seventh studio album by the English <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative%20rock\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">alternative rock</a> band Radiohead.
