{"album": {"wiki": {"content": "Drops of Jupiter is Train's second album, released in 2001. The album's title is derived from &quot;Drops of Jupiter&quot;, its first single, which won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song.\n \n The album contains elements of rock, country and indie rock. Besides &quot;Drops of Jupiter&quot;, two other singles were released from this album: &quot;She's on Fire&quot; and &quot;Something More,&quot; both of which also achieved some success on the Adult Top 40 chart.\n \n Debuting at #6 in the United States upon its release, it has since been certified 2x Platinum by the RIAA in the United States and 2x Platinum by the CRIA in Canada. It is the band's best selling album to date.\n \n The album received mixed reviews. AMG Writer Mark Morgenstein said that &quot;There is nothing cutting edge about Train's Sophomore Effort&quot; He also stated that &quot;Train is a classic rock wannabe band in the mold of Counting Crows, although that's not always a bad thing&quot;.\n \n Rolling Stone Writer Aidin Vaziri had this to say about the album: &quot;Drops of Jupiter, conjuring vivid memories of Recovering The Satellites. The anthemic song is the centerpiece here, showcasing the singer's yearning voice and band's swooping, string-laden melodies, but Train has more to offer. The brooding &quot;Mississippi&quot; presents an intoxicating mix of acoustic guitars and dreamy horns, while &quot;Let It Roll&quot; mixes mournful slide guitars and loose-limbed rhythms in the perfect meeting of blustery earnestness and unapologetic commerciality.&quot; \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Drops of Jupiter is Train's second album, released in 2001.
