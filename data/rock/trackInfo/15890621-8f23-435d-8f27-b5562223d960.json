I felt like I had become a parent figure or part of the problem.&quot;\n \n About the relationship between the song and concerns about gun violence, Way said:\n \n \u201cThat song almost didn't fit on the record but it's a topic that's so important to our culture. It's about a really big problem in America where kids are killing kids. The only thing I learned in high school is that people are very violent and territorial.\u201d \n \n This song was #25 on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007. This song was also #80 on MTV Asia's list of Top 100 Hits of 2007. It uses the beat from the song Bang a Gong (Get It On) by the band T Rex.
