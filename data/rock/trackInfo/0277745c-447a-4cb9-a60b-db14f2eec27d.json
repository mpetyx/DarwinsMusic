The song is the album's opening track, and was released as its first single, reaching #3 in Ireland, #5 in the USA, #6 in the UK and #2 in Cherry's native Sweden. It is considered to be his signature song.\n \n It was featured on the video games Karaoke Revolution and American Idol and was featured in the movie A Lot Like Love.\n \n  Music video - - - -\n \n The monochrome video for the song features Cherry playing different characters and seeing the story from different perspectives. At first, he is a man getting ready for a date by buying some roses and a bottle of wine at a deli. He then tells the butcher &quot;goodbye&quot; and the camera reveals that the butcher is in fact Cherry himself. A robber wearing a ski mask then comes along and takes the money out of the cash register. As he leaves, however, he is run over by a van, and as bystanders help him up, he is revealed to be Cherry, as is the driver in the van. Another Cherry is seen playing a guitar and another is a bum on the street. The &quot;first&quot; Cherry appears once again at the end of the video, apparently walking to his date's place.\n \n 1998 Chart  Peak position\n ____________________\n Austrian Singles Chart  -  #17 \n Belgian Singles Chart -  # 9 \n Dutch Mega Singles Top 100 -  # 9 \n French Singles Chart -  # 11 \n German Singles Chart -  # 18 \n Irish Singles Chart -  #3 \n New Zealand RIANZ Singles Charts -  # 35 \n Norwegian Singles Chart -  # 9 \n Swedish Top 100 Singles -  # 2 \n Swiss Singles Chart -  # 7 \n UK Top 75 Singles -  # 6 \n U.S. Billboard Adult Top 40 -  # 3 \n U.S. Billboard Modern Rock Tracks -  # 8 \n U.S. Billboard Hot 100 -  # 5 \n U.S. Billboard Top 40 Mainstream -  # 1 \n U.S. Billboard Top 40 Tracks -  # 1 \n U.S. Billboard Adult Recurrents -  # 1 \n  \n 1999 - End of year chart  Position \n U.S. Billboard Hot 100  -  #22 \n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Save Tonight&quot; is a rock single written by Eagle-Eye Cherry for his 1997 debut album Desireless.
