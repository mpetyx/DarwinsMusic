It was released as the first single from their third album, Phobia. The song is one of their most notable and successful, it is the fastest added single ever in the history of Hollywood Records. It is also known to be, and is still, the most popular Breaking Benjamin song since the band first formed. It gained a massive amount of radio play throughout the United States and was added at the place of #1 under three rock charts. Additionally, it is the band's only single to chart the Billboard Pop 100. The song is a slight departure from the band, featuring more of a nu metal sound rather than their signature alternative metal/post-grunge crossover.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;The Diary of Jane&quot; is a song by American rock band Breaking Benjamin.
