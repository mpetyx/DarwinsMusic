The verses are relatively quiet before <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Edge\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Edge</a>'s guitar and the song's signature riff join in for the choruses. The Edge recorded this song on his Gibson Les Paul Standard and plays the song live with his Gibson Explorer, which helps add the distinctive shimmering, chiming sound that made the band unique when they first debuted in the early 1980s.\n \n In an episode of the Sundance Channel's Iconoclast, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/R.E.M.\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">R.E.M.</a> vocalist <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Stipe\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Michael Stipe</a> said &quot;I love that song.
