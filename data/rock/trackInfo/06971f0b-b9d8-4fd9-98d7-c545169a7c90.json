Scars is considered to be the band's comeback single, despite being unlike their usual work. It is their biggest hit, peaking at #15 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The single was certified gold (500 000 units sold) on June 6, 2005. The song, according the DVD Live &amp; Murderous In Chicago tells the story of Jacoby Shaddix's &quot;Horrible night in Vegas that changed my life.&quot; During live performances before playing the song Shaddix often talks about how &quot;the song saved [his] life.&quot;\n \n Lyrics:\n \n I tear my heart open, I sew myself shut\n My weakness is that I care too much\n And my scars remind me that the past is real\n I tear my heart open just to feel\n \n Drunk and I'm feeling down\n And I just wanna be alone\n I'm pissed cause you came around\n Why don't you just go home\n Cause you channel all your pain\n And I can't help you fix yourself\n You're making me insane\n All I can say is\n \n I tear my heart open, I sew myself shut\n My weakness is that I care too much\n And our scars remind us that the past is real\n I tear my heart open just to feel\n \n I tried to help you once\n Against my own advice\n I saw you going down\n But you never realized\n That you're drowning in the water\n So I offered you my hand\n Compassion's in my nature\n Tonight is our last stand\n \n I tear my heart open, I sew myself shut\n My weakness is that I care too much\n And our scars remind us that the past is real\n I tear my heart open just to feel\n \n I'm drunk and I'm feeling down\n And I just wanna be alone\n You shouldn't ever come around\n Why don't you just go home?\n Cause you're drowning in the water\n And I tried to grab your hand\n I left my heart open\n But you didn't understand\n But you didn't understand\n Go fix yourself\n \n \n I can't help you fix yourself\n But at least I can say I tried\n I'm sorry but I gotta move on with my own life\n I can't help you fix yourself\n But at least I can say I tried\n I'm sorry but I gotta move on with my own life\n \n I tear my heart open, I sew myself shut\n My weakness is that I care too much\n And our scars remind us that the past is real\n I tear my heart open just to feel\n \n I tear my heart open, I sew myself shut\n My weakness is that I care too much\n And our scars remind us that the past is real\n I tear my heart open just to feel\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Scars&quot; is the second single from Papa Roach's third album, Getting Away with Murder (2004), and seventh released single in total.

That's the strength of the song, that even if you don't know the roadmap to life, you can still improvise and do your best and things might turn out okay.  Hence this is a very important and life-affirming song for a lot of people.
