It was recorded with Springsteen supplying almost all of the instrumentation, with bass and background vocals from &quot;Other Band&quot; member Tommy Simms. Additional saxophone and vocal parts by Ornette Coleman and &quot;Little&quot; Jimmy Scott, respectively, were recorded but never used.\n \n Released in early 1994 as the main single from the film's original soundtrack, it became a huge success for Springsteen all over Europe and North America.\n \n The song would achieve greater popularity in Europe than it would in the United States. While it peaked at #9 in the Billboard Hot 100 chart, it would become a number-one single in Germany and France. It would also peak at #2 in the United Kingdom, becoming Springsteen's highest charting hit in that country. It also peaked at #4 in Australia. &quot;Streets of Philadelphia&quot; ranks as his most recent top ten hit.\n \n The song was also included in the album All Time Greatest Movie Songs, released by Sony in 1999.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Streets of Philadelphia&quot; is an Academy Award and Grammy-winning song written and performed by American singer Bruce Springsteen for the 1993 film Philadelphia.
