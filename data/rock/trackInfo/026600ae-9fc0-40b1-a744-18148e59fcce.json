(was reading theVicker's thesis below me) pobrecita ni*a.!!!\r\nentertaining, indeed!!!  =)", "Love this song. I'm an atheist. The line \"it scares the hell out of me\" it purposely ironic, I think. Most of the time I'm not really scared of death... fact is, whether or not you believe the world was around for 4.6 billion years old or only 6000 years old, that's still way more than most people can really conceptualize, and that's also how much time (or more) you DIDN'T exist at one point. So, what's the big deal if you don't exist again? lol. Still, the idea of \"nothingness\" scares me sometimes. Matt has that being an atheist means accepting this is your only life to live, and so you should live it to the fullest, appreciating it, and the only way to live on forever is through influencing the world around you. I agree with his feelings."], "toptags": {"tag": [{"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative%20rock", "name": "alternative rock"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/rock", "name": "rock"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative", "name": "alternative"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/muse", "name": "muse"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/british", "name": "british"}]}, "mbid": "026600ae-9fc0-40b1-a744-18148e59fcce", "duration": "187000", "playcount": "3371267", "id": "2567155"}}
