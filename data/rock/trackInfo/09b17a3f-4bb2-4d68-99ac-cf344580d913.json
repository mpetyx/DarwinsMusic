Released in 2001, it was the first single off the band's long-awaited third album, Weezer, and the only one of  The Summer Sessions songs to make it onto the album, although &quot;Dope Nose&quot; and &quot;Slob&quot; were released on Maladroit. According to an interview with Weezer front man Rivers Cuomo, &quot;Hash Pipe&quot; was written on the same night as the hit song &quot;Dope Nose&quot; off Maladroit. The story goes that Rivers took &quot;a bunch of Ritalin and had like three shots of tequila,&quot; paced around for a while, then wrote both songs. The song was inspired by a male transvestite prostitute known for rambling to people in Santa Monica.\n \n &quot;Hash Pipe&quot; is one of the band's biggest hits, best remembered for its driving guitar melody, offbeat lyrical content, Cuomo's falsetto vocals and the gang backup vocals of &quot;whoa-oh-oh.&quot; The song peaked at #2 on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks chart, #24 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and #16 on Billboard's Canadian Singles Chart. The video for the song was nominated for Best Rock Video at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards as well as being nominated for High Times magazine's &quot;Pot Song of the Year&quot; in 2001 . \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Hash Pipe&quot; is a popular single by Weezer.
