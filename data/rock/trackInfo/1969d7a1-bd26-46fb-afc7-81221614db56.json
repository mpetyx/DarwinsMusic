It is the seventh track on their 1995 album The Bends. Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke wrote the song about a narcissistic friend of his, which on closer inspection is showcased by the imagery in the lyrics - a parallel to earlier My Iron Lung EP track &quot;Lewis [Mistreated]&quot;. He also says that it was somewhat of a competition between him and Jonny Greenwood to see who could fit the most chords into a song. &quot;Just&quot; is especially notable for Greenwood's guitar solo. In the UK, this single was available as two CDs: the first one featured different tracks, and the color of the album art on the second single was inverted. In 2007, NME placed &quot;Just&quot; at number 34 in its list of the 50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Just&quot; is a single by the English rock band Radiohead, released in 1995.
