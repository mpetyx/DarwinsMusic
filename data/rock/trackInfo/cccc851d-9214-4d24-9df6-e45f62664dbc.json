Two months later, Chris indicated it could become the opening track. Put first on the album because it ends in the key of B which is the key of the second track. .\n \n Wolstenholme: We wrote it at the end of the Absolution sessions, and it sounds similar [to Absolution tracks]. It has evolved a lot since then, but it\u2019s principle remains the same: a change of periodic agreements which are at the brink of exploding. Its structure is mathematical, the main idea being a formula with neither chorus nor verse. Dom\u2019s never played like that, with very jazzy rhythms, slow ones, followed by more chaotic bits integrated into the whole.\n \n Take a Bow was often played as a piano interlude between Citizen Erased and Space Dementia on the Absolution tour. It was also used in a cinematic trailer for the film <em>Watchmen</em>.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Take a Bow calls on world leaders to take responsibility for their actions.
