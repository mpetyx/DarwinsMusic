Definitely one of my favourites.", "[1 of 2] OP 11-14-2004 @ 04:44:49 AM. As opposed to the spiritual The Scientist, GPASOYF is an agnostic song. See the reverse psychology of the Coldplay titles. TS being 'believing' is contradictory to the traditional Science VS Religion wars & debates '...now when we work out where to draw the line your guess is as good as mine...' This is the essence of the song & sung many times. In the end...all the atheists, capitalists, nihilist, anarchists, Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, Evangelicals, greedy business men, deists etc et al have something of value to say, as it all tries to find the answer to the Time Immemorial (...a glorious mission to find The Invisible One...Crowded House) question of God's existence. So in the end nobody really knows, we're all AGNOSTIC: undecided/sitting on the fence to some degree. The opening verse is about uncertainity, there are too many choices, human beings don't know which road to take, there's too much clutter in today's rat race capitilist society.", "[2 of 2] The third verse is stating the infallible human insecurity/inferiority complex/loneliness. We always put ourselves down. We devalue our opinions for fear of rejection. So when one of us works it out, finds all the questions to life problems, mysteries and puzzles: we all all want (as opposed to say love, or need) to know that answer. So please share it: long live bi-polar Ambivalent Agnosticism (ala John Lennon's Imagine)...sometimes believer, sometimes sceptic...\"I HATE REPEATING MYSELF\" - MEL GIBSON - 'CONSPIRACY THEORY'.", "God doesn't.
