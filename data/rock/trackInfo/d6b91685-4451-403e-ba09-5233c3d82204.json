It is the second single released from their 2007 album, Because of the Times, and the ninth track on the album. Lyrically, the song pays homage to the band's fans in the UK, where the band have traditionally enjoyed more success than in their homeland: &quot;All of London sing / Cos England swings and they sure love the tales I bring&quot;.\n \n Musically, the song features a combination of both electric and acoustic guitars, with a pounding bass line. The song was released as a single on July 9, 2007. It was the band's highest-charting single at the time, reaching number 13 on the UK Singles Chart (&quot;Sex on Fire&quot; would reach the number one position in September 2008). The single peaked at number 19 on the Irish Singles Chart.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Fans&quot; is a song by American rock band Kings of Leon.
