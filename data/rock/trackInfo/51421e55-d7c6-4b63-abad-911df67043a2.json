Yes yes, we all know the debut is amazing but to play the devil's advocate it's essentially just rapping over hard rock riffs. Whereas on Battle they came up with the perfect alchemy of hip hop, hard rock, funk, punk and what have you. It's musically and sonically their most inventive album. As revolutionary as they were from the get-go, a song like this in 1992 would have blown heads off.", "Morello's guitar ([^.^])", "hellz yeah, luv it", "This song is just massive.
