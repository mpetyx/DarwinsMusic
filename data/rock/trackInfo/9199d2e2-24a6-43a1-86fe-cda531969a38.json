It was released as the album's second internationally released single in 2004 (see 2004 in music) and became Lavigne's third most successful single . It peaked higher than &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;, the album's first single. In the United Kingdom, it reached the top five, in the United States, it peaked at number nine, doing better in Mexico where it peaked at number 1. The RIAA certified &quot;My Happy Ending&quot; platinum in January 2005, making it Lavigne's second platinum single after &quot;Complicated&quot; (2002). The song contains the word shit, which generated a small amount of controversy. This song was once very popular on Radio Disney, and because Disney is targeted toward children, the word shit was replaced by stuff in the radio edit of the song.\n \n Structurally, the song is written in 4/4 style and has a repeated hook in both the chorus and in the intro and outro. The song's bridge is hailed as the strongest bridge in Lavigne's songs both vocally and lyrically.\n \n LYRICS\n so much for my happy ending\n so much for my happy ending\n oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...\n \n Let's talk this over\n It's not like we're dead\n Was it something I did?\n Was it something you said?\n Don't leave me hanging\n In a city so dead\n Held up so high\n On such a breakable thread\n \n You were all the things I thought I knew\n And I thought we could be\n \n You were everything, everything that I wanted\n We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it\n All of our memories, so close to me, just fade away\n All this time you were pretending\n So much for my happy ending\n \n You've got your dumb friends\n I know what they say\n They tell you I'm difficult\n But so are they\n But they don't know me\n Do they even know you?\n All the things you hide from me\n All the shit that you do\n \n You were all the things I thought I knew\n And I thought we could be\n \n You were everything, everything that I wanted\n We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it\n All of our memories, so close to me, just fade away\n All this time you were pretending\n So much for my happy ending\n \n It's nice to know that you were there\n Thanks for acting like you care\n And making me feel like I was the only one\n It's nice to know we had it all\n Thanks for watching as I fall\n And letting me know we were done\n \n He was everything, everything that I wanted\n We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it\n All of our memories, so close to me, just fade away\n All this time you were pretending\n So much for my happy ending\n \n You were everything, everything that I wanted\n We were meant to be, supposed to be\n But we lost it\n All of our memories so close to me\n Just fade away\n All this time you were pretending\n So much for my happy ending\n Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...\n \n So much for my happy ending\n Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...\n \n So much for my happy ending\n Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh... \n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;My Happy Ending&quot; is a song written and produced by Avril Lavigne and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Butch+Walker\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Butch Walker</a> for Lavigne's second album, Under My Skin (2004).
