It was released as the sixth and final single from the album in 2004. It became the fifth consecutive single from Meteora to reach #1 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, a feat unmatched by any other artist in the history of that chart. It was also the second single from the album to reach #1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. It was a pop hit, peaking at #20 on the Billboard Hot 100 on September 7, 2004.\n Breaking the Habit features many electronics, live strings and guitar. There are no distorted guitar riffs, and it is the first single released by Linkin Park to include no vocals from Mike Shinoda.\n A common misconception about this song is that it was written by lead singer Chester Bennington, when in fact, band member Mike Shinoda was the original writer. The song was based on a close friend's drug addiction.[citation needed] It is a common idea that it was written about Bennington due to his extended drug abuse issues, although Shinoda began writing the song before he met Bennington.[citation needed] The rumour has its roots in Bennington's reluctance to play the song at early live shows, because he was able to relate to it so closely.\n In an issue of Kerrang, Mike Shinoda mentioned that the song was originally going to be an instrumental track over ten minutes long, but was convinced by the band to change it.[1]\n \n Notable cover: <a title=\"Bugotak &ndash; What I see is what I sing about (a parody to Linkin Park's Breaking The Habit)\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bugotak/_/What+I+see+is+what+I+sing+about+(a+parody+to+Linkin+Park%27s+Breaking+The+Habit)\" class=\"bbcode_track\">What I see is what I sing about (a parody to Linkin Park's Breaking The Habit)</a>\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; is an electronica-influenced song by the nu metal band Linkin Park, from their 2003 album Meteora.
