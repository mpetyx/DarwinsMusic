It was originally included on the <a title=\"Queen - A Night at the Opera\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/A+Night+at+the+Opera\" class=\"bbcode_album\">A Night at the Opera</a> album in 1975, and later released as a single, with <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+May\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Brian May</a>'s <a title=\"Queen &ndash; '39\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/%2739\" class=\"bbcode_track\">'39</a> as its B-side. The song also appeared on the <a title=\"Queen - Greatest Hits\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/Greatest+Hits\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Greatest Hits</a> (1981) album.\n \n Deacon wrote the song for his wife, Veronica, to whom he remains married to this day. In this song, he plays a Wurlitzer electric piano in addition to bass guitar. The characteristic 'bark' of the Wurlitzer's bass notes plays a prominent role in the song. During live performances, the band used a grand piano rather than an electric, and it would be played by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Freddie+Mercury\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Freddie Mercury</a>, while Deacon played the bass guitar.\n \n For the music video, it shows the band in a huge ballroom surrounded by over one thousand candles, including a huge chandelier hung above them on the ceiling. The video was filmed in the summer of 1976. (May later mentioned that the video was shot in the middle of a very unpleasant heatwave and the ballroom in which they were filming did not have air conditioning.) Also, Deacon is seen playing a grand piano, even though he plays a regular electric on the recording.\n \n The band answered Tom Browne on 24 December 1977 in a live BBC Radio One interview, regarding Deacon's control of the piano for the recording.\n \n John Deacon: &quot;Well, Freddie didn\u2019t like the electric piano, so I took it home and I started to learn on the electric piano and basically that\u2019s the song that came out you know when I was learning to play piano. It was written on that instrument and it sounds best on that. You know, often on the instrument that you wrote the song on.&quot;\n \n Freddie Mercury: I refused to play the damn thing (the Wurlitzer). It\u2019s tiny and horrible and I don\u2019t like them. Why play those things when you\u2019ve got a lovely superb grand piano? No, I think, basically what he [John] is trying to say is it was the desired effect.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;You're My Best Friend&quot; is a song penned by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/John+Deacon\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">John Deacon</a> and performed by British rock band <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Queen</a>.
