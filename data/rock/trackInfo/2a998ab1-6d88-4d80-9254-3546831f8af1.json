Honestly, even though I LOVE this song, you can kinda hear the labor put into it... it tends to rely on the sound fx too much for the style of Absolution, and especially with Matt's live singing style, it would get kinda old past the 2 minute mark.  Muse knows what songs are good for studio, and which are good for live, so you gotta give some props to them for sticking to their guns :D", "Very nice song...", "LUV IT!!!!", "this song has a U2 vibe, very beautiful nevertheless"], "toptags": {"tag": [{"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative%20rock", "name": "alternative rock"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/rock", "name": "rock"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/muse", "name": "muse"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative", "name": "alternative"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/british", "name": "british"}]}, "mbid": "2a998ab1-6d88-4d80-9254-3546831f8af1", "duration": "280000", "playcount": "3542795", "id": "2722972"}}
