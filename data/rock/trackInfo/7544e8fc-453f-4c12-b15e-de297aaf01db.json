It was released as the second single from their album Extreme Behavior. It was their breakthrough hit, charting in the Top Ten on several Billboard trade charts in the United States, and reaching Number One in several countries. A second cover version was released in early 2007 by country music artist Jack Ingram. His version, which was his third Top 40 country hit, peaked in the Top 20 on the Billboard country music charts.\n \n \n The lyrics deal with a singer describing his feelings when his assumed ex-girlfriend calls him late at night. They are both in relationships at the time; however, the singer tells of how his feelings are still predominantly with her, and it seems hers are also still with him. More than once, a reference to the call being secret is made, and the singer expresses concern of a fight ensuing as a result. The song concludes just as it began, with the singer questioning to why she is calling so late.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Lips of an Angel&quot; is a power ballad by Oklahoma rock band Hinder written by Austin Winkler and Cody Hanson.
