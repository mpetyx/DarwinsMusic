He wrote the song in the store sitting at a kitchen display they had set up. Many of the lyrics were things they actually said.\n \n The song was notable for its controversial lyrics, groundbreaking music video and a cameo appearance by Sting singing the song's iconic falsetto introduction and backing chorus, a borrowing of the cable network's slogan &quot;I want my MTV&quot;.This chorus mirrors The Police intro to &quot;don't stand so close to me&quot;. The video was also the first to be aired on MTV Europe when the network started on August 1, 1987.\n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Money for Nothing&quot; is a song by British group Dire Straits, which first appeared on their 1985 album Brothers in Arms and subsequently became an international hit when released as a single.
