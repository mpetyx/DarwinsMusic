Due to its status as a Bond theme it was also covered by The Pretenders (released exclusively on the album Shaken and Stirred: The David Arnold James Bond Project), and Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas performed the song on Movies Rocks 2007, a CBS special celebrating music in movies. British pop singer Geri Halliwell , of the Spice Girls, released the song as a b-side track for her solo number one single Lift Me Up, in November 1999.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Live and Let Die&quot; is the main theme song of the 1973 James Bond film Live and Let Die and was performed by Paul McCartney and Wings on the movie soundtrack and on the soundtrack album.
