In 2006 it was added to the Library of Congress National Recording Registry.\n \n The song was first released as a single in the United States in June 1965 and was also featured on the American version of the Rolling Stones album Out of Our Heads, released in July of the same year. &quot;Satisfaction&quot; was a smash hit, giving the Stones their first number one in the United States. In Europe, the song initially played only on pirate radio stations because its lyrics were considered too sexually suggestive. In Britain the single was released in August 1965, and shot to number one in the United Kingdom; it was the Rolling Stones' fourth UK number one. (The British version of Out of Our Heads, released in September 1965, did not feature &quot;Satisfaction&quot;; it was not standard practice in the United Kingdom at that time to include previously-released singles on albums.)\n \n The lyrics of the song include references to sexual intercourse, and the theme of anti-commercialism caused the song to be &quot;perceived as an attack on the status quo&quot;.\n \n Otis Redding, Devo, Blue Cheer, Gloria Trevi, Alejandra Guzm\u00e1n, Vanilla Ice, Britney Spears, The Residents, The Supremes and Cat Power are among the artists who have covered the song.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction is a hit riff-driven rock song written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards for The Rolling Stones and produced by Andrew Loog Oldham.
