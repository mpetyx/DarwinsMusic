It was released as the album's third single in August 1987 . Bono was inspired to write the lyrics by the notion that it is possible to identify a person's religion and income based on the street on which they lived, particularly in Belfast. Amidst difficulties recording the song, producer Brian Eno attempted to erase the song from the recording tapes. The song's signature is a repeating guitar arpeggio utilizing a delay effect that is played at the beginning and end of the song.\n \n The song peaked at #14 in Canada, #10 in The Netherlands and #4 in the United Kingdom. The song has become one of the band's most popular songs, and it has remained a staple of the band's live act since the song debuted in 1987 on the Joshua Tree Tour. The song was notably performed on a Los Angeles rooftop for the filming of its music video, which won a Grammy Award for &quot;Best Performance Music Video&quot;. Rolling Stone ranked the song at #28 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time.&quot;\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot; is a song by Irish rock band U2 and the opening track from their 1987 album The Joshua Tree.
