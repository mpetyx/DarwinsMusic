It yearns for humans to go back to it's original purity - Adam & Eve. 'Come back and haunt me' is like the ghosts of history warning, shadowing us. 'Running in circles, chasing tails, coming back as we are' is the endless human mother nature cycle of good/bad, ying/yang, life/death, and for the believers: heaven/hell. The last verse is ZEITGEIST...we will forever part/distance ourselves from Gaia, Purity because of capitalism, 'science and progress'. We will never return to the innocence of Adam & Eve, the world is corrupted, money hungry, materialistic, full of divorce, hungry people, greedy businessmen etc et al...\"", "Song for eternity", "nice"], "toptags": {"tag": [{"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/coldplay", "name": "coldplay"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/rock", "name": "rock"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative", "name": "alternative"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/britpop", "name": "britpop"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/british", "name": "british"}]}, "mbid": "1504a675-4a3d-4103-96f5-22970eb4f6bf", "duration": "306000", "playcount": "11098815", "id": "1004949"}}
