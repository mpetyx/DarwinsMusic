[2]", "Best song of Stadium Arcadium according me [3] I'd put it up in their top five best songs", "In my sight this is one of the best songs ever written.

Anyway, this song is genious too!", "I've always thought that John put his personal story in this solo: it's like he was able to turn his life events and experiences into notes... So beautiful and sad at the same time, I can't describe how many feelings it gives me.", "That's so sad, but I have to say it again. Well fuck you, Red Hot Chili Peppers, it's the most fucking beautiful song ever written, and it makes me wanna fucking die at the same time. Again. [2]", "Meu rem\u00e9dio pra dor de cabe\u00e7a.
