I almost feel reborn a bit hearing him talk in ways that feel so familiar to probably millions of people. Living in China where people are cold and disinterested in each other is a drastic film negative of the kind of thought processes human beings should develop... thanks for pushing yourself jack.", "@roemilca111: Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking! Regardless, I love Jack White; this guy is awesome!", "does anyone hear a bit of Zappa in this?", "On the recording, the frantic drum beat was created by a \"tape kick back\" thing, if I remember correctly how Jack put it. But since then, his two drummers have figured out how to play it live: because they are both bad ass :D", "Love the frantic drum beat that compliments the vocal pace", "Great riff.", "Jack is the real deal.  He is devoted to his music in a non ego fashion.", "The vocals resemble Jimmy slightly with the vibratos but, in no way is this Jungle Pop Pussy Punk. Jimmy sings about being as offensive as possible to a drum machine and heavy guitar. Jack kind of misses that. \n\nListen to MSI's first album (self titled). That is the closest you'll get to Jack with MSI", "just noticed how much I like this song", "so weird :)", "<3", "\"Early Rush\" and \"Mindless Self Indulgence\"? Wtf are you people listening to?", "in the words that Bill Murray said \"sure\" Bill Murray Bill Murray Bill Murray"], "toptags": {"tag": [{"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/rock", "name": "rock"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/indie%20rock", "name": "indie rock"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/blues", "name": "blues"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/indie", "name": "indie"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/rogue%20stereo", "name": "rogue stereo"}]}, "mbid": "", "duration": "171000", "playcount": "876693", "id": "568084940"}}
