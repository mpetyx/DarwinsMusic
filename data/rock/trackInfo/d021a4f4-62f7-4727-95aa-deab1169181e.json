Early live versions featured an extended outro that featured parts of the song Execution Commentary, as well as extra lyrics.\n \n The descending vocals towards the end of the song have been played intermittently through time. During early 2001 it wasn't sung at all, and post 2002 it wasn't usually sung, although one example of the descending vocals post-2002 was at The Mercy Lounge in 2004. In the latter half of the 2005 tour, the post-final-chorus section was used as an outro to Stockholm Syndrome on at least two occasions.\n \n Micro Cuts made a return to set lists during the 2007 European tour. The first performance of 2007 featured a largely clean guitar (without effects), while further performances feature a &quot;new effect&quot;, which mimics the layering on the album recording. The descending vocals have not returned, while vocals have been clean so far. After the final chorus and before the final decent, Bellamy has used the chaos pad to create a sound similar to the Kaoss pad solo and outro used with live Supermassive Black Hole performances. \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Matt Bellamy has said the song was inspired by a dream he had in which he was in desert and there were giant blades swinging from the sky.
