It was one of the band's (and Tom Kirk's) favourite songs to play live during the Absolution tour.\n \n At 3:19 in the song, there is a very subtle mistake in Bellamy's playing.\n \n The video that plays in the background during live performances counts down to the piano climax, appearing to count down to an apocalyptic event, such as an atomic bomb explosion.\n \n The title and the song's meaning are also related to a book called Rule by Secrecy by Jim Marrs, a book about conspiracy theories of how there are secret societies dictating the way the world is run. The song probably refers to the 'underground' group called Illuminati. \n \n At the end, a heart-beat can be heard. It's very quiet though it is possible to hear. There is also a Shepard Tone as the songs fades out. \n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Matthew Bellamy: &quot;It's about some geezer who's come back from work and he's just kinda like shot everyone and blown everyone up, and he's come back to his wife with like a load of blood all over his hands going 'I've just blown it ...
