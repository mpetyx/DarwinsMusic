It has gospel-tinged melodies and saccharine guitar leads. It won the &quot;Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal&quot; in 2002. \n \n U2's lead singer Bono wrote the song about the suicide of his close friend Michael Hutchence, the late lead singer of the band INXS. The song is written in the form of an argument about suicide in which Bono tries to convince Hutchence of the act's foolishness.\n \n Bono characterized the song as a fight between friends, which he felt guilty for never having with Hutchence. &quot;It's a row between mates. You're kinda trying to wake them up out of an idea. In my case it's a row I didn't have while he was alive. I feel the biggest respect I could pay to him was not to write some stupid soppy fucking song, so I wrote a really tough, nasty little number, slapping him around the head. And I'm sorry, but that's how it came out of me.&quot; --Bono, in Rolling Stone (November 3, 2005 issue)\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of&quot; is a single release from U2's 2000 album, All That You Can't Leave Behind.
