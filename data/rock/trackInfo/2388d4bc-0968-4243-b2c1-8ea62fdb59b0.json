Feels formulaic on a record that most definitely isn't.", "I just love him! \u2764", "I like the album... but this song is boring compared to the rest. Sorry.", "perfeita", "Blunderbuss was so aggressively promoted and had such high expectations before it came out, I was afraid it wouldn't live up to the hype. But the attention was well deserved, and the album doesn't disappoint.", "Fantastic", "Jack White always delivers - in an even grander fashion solo than with any of his previous bands! We can chalk it up to Jack being a master ... definitive sound and sarcastic, raw lyrics that pull it all together :) Just give the man his own Grammy now - he's among the few artists out now who deserve their praise.", "he can play the shit outta the piano! love him SO much", "Another great song from the musical genius Jack White.", "one of my fav songs from blunderbuss", "yep, truly the stones style.", "LOVE IT!!!!!", "Too bad The Stones don't sound like this anymore. They should get Jack to produce them next time.", "The whole album is kinda disappointing after The White Stripes, but I just can't stop listening the song."], "toptags": {"tag": [{"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/rock", "name": "rock"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/blues%20rock", "name": "blues rock"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/2012", "name": "2012"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/southern%20rock", "name": "southern rock"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/blues", "name": "blues"}]}, "mbid": "2388d4bc-0968-4243-b2c1-8ea62fdb59b0", "duration": "200000", "playcount": "476685", "id": "568085063"}}
