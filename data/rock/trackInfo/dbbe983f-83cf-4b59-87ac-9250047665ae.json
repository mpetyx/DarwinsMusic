It took them 39 attempts, after which they added lead vocals and re-recorded the drums and bass guitar parts.\n \n On 28 July they added more vocals, guitar, percussion and piano. The song was completed two days later with additional guitar and percussion.\n \n This song was performed directly after &quot;Polythene Pam&quot;, the song on the preceding track, without pause. John Lennon and Ringo Starr assume their usually respective roles on the acoustic rhythm guitar and the drums. Allegedly, McCartney plays lead guitar on this song, while George Harrison plays the bass part.\n \n At the very beginning of the song, John Lennon says, &quot;We'll listen to that now...Oh, look out!&quot; Lennon then says, &quot;You should&quot;.\n \n A slower, ethereal version of this song, recorded during the Let It Be sessions, can be heard on Anthology 3.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;She Came in Through the Bathroom Window&quot; is a song written by Paul McCartney (although credited to Lennon/McCartney) and performed by The Beatles on their album Abbey Road as part of the Abbey Road medley.\n The Beatles recorded the rhythm track for this and Polythene Pam as one on 25 July 1969.
