This song exemplifies all that is great about U2. I'm sure they could very easily write cheasy pop songs about horse shit topics like most of the other garbage bands out there, but I remember Bono once said that a true artist choses to \"Reveal rather than conceal\" and that's what makes them great. He is right, obviously this song is incredibly personal and these lyrics are absolutely heartfelt by Bono. I haven't spoken to my father in years, and this song just always tears me up..... I appreciate the fact that there are bands out there like U2, who continue to be original and choose to lead instead of follow.", "Great song! Bono is truely a saint.", ":-)", "This song always brings me to tears, reminding me of the father that I haven't spoken to in 5 years.", "26th sept 2012, RIP, DAD. mx", "Truly a masterpiece ! best part is the bridge so beautiful!", "makes me remember and think of my mother", "Listen to U2 on my radio station!", "the soul of the song. if i were bono's dad, i'd forgive him.", "its you its you on your own.more then singing a song.on your own", "yea not bad ........crokepark85", "this song makes me cry", "muito linda esta musica", "wonderful song", "Always makes me wanna cry.
