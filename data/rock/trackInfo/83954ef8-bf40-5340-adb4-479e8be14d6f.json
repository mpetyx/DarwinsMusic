Backed with &quot;Civil War&quot; from Use Your Illusion II, the single reached number twenty-nine on the Billboard Hot 100 chart[1] and number three on the UK Singles Chart.\n \n Contrary to popular belief, &quot;You Could Be Mine&quot; was not originally going to be the official theme of Terminator 2: Judgment Day. However, the references to Guns N' Roses that were made in the film (from John Connor's friend's Guns N' Roses t-shirt to the T-800 taking out his shotgun from a box of roses, thus playing a pun on the band's name) were so clear and obvious that it was a wise business decision to make when director James Cameron decided to recruit the band to perform a song. As it would turn out, &quot;You Could Be Mine&quot; was selected to be included in the film. Arnold Schwarzenegger had the band members over for dinner at his own home to negotiate the deal.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;You Could Be Mine&quot; is a song by American hard rock band Guns N' Roses, featured on their 1991 fourth studio album Use Your Illusion II.
