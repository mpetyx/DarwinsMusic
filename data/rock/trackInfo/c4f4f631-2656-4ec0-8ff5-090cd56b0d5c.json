The song received a nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards.\n &quot;Lonely Day&quot; features a dreary musical theme with a heavy chorus and a dual guitar solo near the end. The chorus is notable for featuring the double superlative &quot;most loneliest&quot;.\n The song is featured in the 2007 film Disturbia, as well as the film's trailer; however, it is not included in the film's soundtrack. Daron did not write the song as a tribute to his brother as rumored, as Daron is an only child.\n The music video features the band on a tour bus with interspliced shots of Hollywood and sections on fire. About 45 seconds into the video, there is a reference to the Pink Floyd Wish You Were Here album sleeve on a reflected piece of glass. The doodle that bassist Shavo Odadjian is seen to be sketching in the video can be found on his Facebook profile.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Lonely Day&quot; is the second single from the 2005 album Hypnotize by Armenian American rock band System of a Down.
