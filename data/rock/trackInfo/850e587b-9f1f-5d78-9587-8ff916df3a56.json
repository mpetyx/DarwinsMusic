It was released in February 2004. The song signals a drastic departure from Blink-182's usual upbeat, crudely humorous style, presenting a somber theme and a slower pace. In the music video, the band plays at a haunted mansion. The video was also featured on their Greatest Hits album.\n The song reached number one on the Billboard Modern Rock chart and peaked at number 42 on the Billboard Hot 100. Although &quot;All the Small Things&quot; had more radio airplay, &quot;I Miss You&quot; sold more singles, being certified gold for selling over 500,000 copies (RIAA gold single certification). The song was a top ten hit single in the United Kingdom, peaking at number eight in 2004.\n \n The lyrics in the introduction are a reference to the movie The Nightmare Before Christmas - &quot;We can Live like Jack and Sally if we want... and have Halloween on Christmas.&quot;\n Blink-182 played this song with electric guitars at their live shows in support of the album.\n Tom DeLonge often plays this at shows with his band Angels &amp; Airwaves.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;I Miss You&quot; is the second single from Blink-182's 2003 self titled album.
