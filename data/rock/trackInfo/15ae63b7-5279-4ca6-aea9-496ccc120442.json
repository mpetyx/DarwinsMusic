Two airline mechanics (played by Tenacious D) hide what appears to be drugs in the coffee-maker (it is revealed in the band's official website that the package is actually labelled &quot;World Domination brand 'Erotic' Sleeping Powder&quot;), which ends up incapacitating everyone who drinks the coffee. The band, having avoided the coffee, finds themselves forced to land the plane.
