The 7&quot; vinyl includes &quot;I'll Try Anything Once&quot;, performed by Julian Casablancas on the keyboard. The music video for &quot;Heart in a Cage&quot; was directed by Samuel Bayer, and was shot in New York City. It was shot in black and white and featured the band members playing in various locations in the city, such as on tall skyscrapers, or, in singer Julian Casablancas's case, the pavement. As said in Rolling Stone, Albert Hammond, Jr. almost died on the set of the shooting of the video when 40 mph winds almost blew him off the top of the building. Hammond commented that &quot;It's not like it's the first time I've almost died on a shooting for a music video.&quot;\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Heart in a Cage&quot; is the second single from The Strokes' third album, First Impressions of Earth released in the UK on 20 March 2006, and worldwide 18 April 2006.\n The CD1 version of the single featured their cover of Ramones' &quot;Life's a Gas&quot; as a B-side, while the CD2 version featured an early version of the song &quot;You Only Live Once&quot; (previously named &quot;I'll Try Anything Once&quot;), along with the single's music video.", "published": "Wed, 13 Oct 2010 18:13:39 +0000"}, "streamable": {"#text": "0", "fulltrack": "0"}, "name": "Heart In a Cage", "artist": {"url": "http://www.last.fm/music/The+Strokes", "mbid": "f181961b-20f7-459e-89de-920ef03c7ed0", "name": "The Strokes"}, "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/The+Strokes/_/Heart+In+a+Cage", "listeners": "501396", "toptags": {"tag": [{"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/rock", "name": "rock"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/indie%20rock", "name": "indie rock"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/indie", "name": "indie"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative", "name": "alternative"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/the%20strokes", "name": "the strokes"}]}, "mbid": "5ac86d24-38ee-4af5-8d03-03fb367a054d", "duration": "206000", "playcount": "3720980", "id": "28268490"}}
