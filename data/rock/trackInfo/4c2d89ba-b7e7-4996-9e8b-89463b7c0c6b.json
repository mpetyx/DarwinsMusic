The song is characteristic of the band's stylistic shift from rap and funk towards a mellower sound, evident in their latest albums. \u201cSlow Cheetah\u201d is unusual in that it is one of the few songs on Stadium Arcadium to feature the use of an acoustic guitar.\n \n Andrew Perry of The Observer notes that within the dreamy, anthemic atmosphere of \u201cSlow Cheetah,\u201d the Chili Peppers transmute their funk and metal into a much mellower and softer style, whilst sacrificing little of their passion and energy. David M. Goldstein of Cokemachineglow writes that \u201cSlow Cheetah\u201d is \u201can example of how the band has learned to function in slower tempos without inducing sleep.\u201d Stadium Arcadium received generally positive reviews, and even won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 2007.\n \n For much of Stadium Arcadium, guitarist John Frusciante experiments with a vast array of synthesized effects, many of which are reminiscent of the idiosyncratic timbres found on 2004\u2019s Shadows Collide With People. The ghostly outro of \u201cSlow Cheetah\u201d is a clear example of Frusciante\u2019s affinity for psychedelia, and provides a stark contrast to the song\u2019s acoustic beginning. The backwards guitar at the song\u2019s outro is similar to 1991\u2019s \u201cGive It Away\u201d, where Frusciante used the same technique. Both \u201cSlow Cheetah\u201d and \u201cGive It Away\u201d draw heavily from Jimi Hendrix\u2019s guitar technique in \u201cCastles Made of Sand,\u201d as well as from the famous backmasking in the Beatles' song \u201cTomorrow Never Knows.\u201d Flea\u2019s bass in \u201cSlow Cheetah\u201d is characteristic of his minimalist techniques found in By The Way and Stadium Arcadium \u2013 a radical departure from his funky, slap-bass style commonly used on pre-Californication albums.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Slow Cheetah is a rock and roll song from the Red Hot Chili Peppers' 2006 album Stadium Arcadium.
