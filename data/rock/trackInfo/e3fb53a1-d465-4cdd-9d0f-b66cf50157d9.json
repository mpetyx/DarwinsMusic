The song is about a person that acts like someone else for acceptance and later realizes that he is not happy in the way he is living.\n \n The video shows Deryck singing while he walks on an empty street. While he walks, trucks with one clear side pass behind him, showing the rest of the band members within and labeling them as having &quot;the perfect vacation,&quot; &quot;the perfect night,&quot; &quot;the perfect family,&quot; and &quot;the perfect body.&quot; In the end there is a truck with Deryck sitting alone in a sparsely-furnished room, labelled &quot;the perfect life.&quot; As the final chord strikes, the &quot;F&quot; falls off, which leaves him with &quot;the perfect lie.&quot; The members of the band are all included in the music video as in order ( Deryck, Steve, Dave, Cone, Steve again, and finally Deryck again )\n \n In an interview with Fuse, Deryck noted that the F falling off of the truck was not planned. However, since it fit in with the video's theme, they used it.\n \n Steve stated that they wanted a semi-serious video. &quot;The song is about a relationship, but not necessarily one with a girl. Maybe you're better left alone. Fuck everybody else. The last single <a title=\"Sum 41 &ndash; We're All to Blame\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sum+41/_/We%27re+All+to+Blame\" class=\"bbcode_track\">We're All to Blame</a> was a pretty serious song, too, but we wanted to offset it with a funny video. With this one, we don't want it to be too hokey, but we don't want it to be too serious either. The trick is to make it interesting while playing up the fact that it is a sincere, genuine song.&quot;\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;<a title=\"Sum 41 &ndash; Pieces\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sum+41/_/Pieces\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Pieces</a>&quot; is the second single from <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sum+41\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Sum 41</a>'s 2004 album, <a title=\"Sum 41 - Chuck\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sum+41/Chuck\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Chuck</a>.
