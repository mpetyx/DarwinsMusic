In the UK, the song hit #11 on the charts when released as a single in 1975. The song has many features on it including  a solid vocal performance by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Freddie+Mercury\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Freddie Mercury</a>, who hit some of the highest notes in his career. The song is also noted for its hard riff and vocal harmonies. The song remained a live favourite, performed at virtually every concert from late 1974 through 1986, often played in segments, with the ending played as a reprise.\n \n It was also featured on the 1997 compilation album <a title=\"Queen - Queen Rocks\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/Queen+Rocks\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Queen Rocks</a>.
