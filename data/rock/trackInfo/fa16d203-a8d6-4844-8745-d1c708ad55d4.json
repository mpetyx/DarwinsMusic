Featuring a thunderous beat, a variety of sound effects on the central guitar riff, and an easy rhyming lyric for the audience to shout along with, it was highly effective in its concert-opening role on the Elevation Tour (named after the song) and became a hit in the United States and the United Kingdom.

It has been played at every U2 concert since it debuted, and it is the only song for which <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Edge\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Edge</a> uses his Gibson SG.\n \n The version of the song released as a single was entitled the &quot;Tomb Raider Mix&quot; (mixed by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Leary\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Paul Leary</a> of the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Butthole+Surfers\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Butthole Surfers</a>), differing significantly from the album version, in that it features guitars with a more 'hard rock' sound than the reggae-inspired feel of the album version. The drums in the single version are also harder, with a more traditional rock'n'roll beat. The name comes from its role in the soundtrack to the movie, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider.
