U2 messed with convention by starting the show with the house lights still on. As the recorded intro music to this song played, the band would take the stage and start the show under the house lights. Somewhere in the middle of the song, the house lights would cut and the stage lights would come on. U2 tried this on the first show of the tour, and the response was so strong that they did it for the remainder of the tour.  http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1064", "Entourage", "Maybe you can educate my mind...", "\"...A mole, living in a hole, digging up my soul now, going down, excavation.
