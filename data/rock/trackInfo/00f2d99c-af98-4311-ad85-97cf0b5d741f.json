It was released in 2000 as a single from the band's third studio album Thirteen Tales From Urban Bohemia. The <a href=\"http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=5077\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bohemian Like You Songfacts</a> explains it was inspired by a girl in a car that Courtney Taylor-Taylor, the Dandy Warhols' guitarist and principal songwriter, found himself fantasizing about as was idly looking out of his apartment window watching traffic pull up at the lights below. \n \n On its original release, it just missed the Top 40 in the UK, peaking at #42. However, it was re-released in 2001, after featuring in a popular Vodafone ad, and peaked at #5.\n \n The intro of the song is reminiscent of The Specials' &quot;Little Bitch&quot;, and the song features riffs similar to The Rolling Stones' &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;.\n \n The song's video is controversial and gets little daytime airplay, since it features full-frontal male nudity and topless female nudity (with the woman's pubic area covered by her leg). However, when played on some music channels these areas are pixelated.\n \n <strong>Cover Versions</strong>\n Cover versions\n \n The song has also been featured in the movies Igby Goes Down, Flushed Away, Little Nicky and Man of the Year as well as the opening to the episode &quot;Longshot&quot; from the television show Numb3rs. It was also featured on a Vodafone advertisement. For many years it has been the theme music for the BBC Radio phone-in show 6-0-6.\n \n In 2006, a mash-up between &quot;Bohemian Like You&quot; and &quot;Horny&quot; was released as &quot;Horny as a Dandy&quot;.\n \n The song has also been featured in different versions of the PlayStation 2 karaoke game &quot;Sing Star&quot;. \n \n <strong>Advertising</strong>\n The song was used extensively by mobile telephony provider Vodafone when it introduced its brand to many of its worldwide operations in 2001-2004.\n \n Elsewhere, it featured prominently in a number of advertisements commissioned by Ford motor company in advertisement campaign for its Ford Focus car range. In Australia, Holden used the song to promote its Holden Astra range, although the lyrics 'you've got a great car. Yeah, what's wrong with it today?' were edited out of the ad.\n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Bohemian Like You&quot; is a song by American alternative rock band The Dandy Warhols.
