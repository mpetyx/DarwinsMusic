Eric Clapton, who was a good friend of George's, played lead guitar on the album version of the song with a Gibson Les Paul guitar. On The Concert for Bangladesh, he performed it on a Gibson Super 400 hollowbody guitar, and later acknowledged that a solid-body guitar would have been more appropriate.\n According to Harrison, inspiration for the song came from reading the I Ching, which, as he put it, &quot;seemed to me to be based on the Eastern concept that everything is relative to everything else, as opposed to the Western view that things are merely coincidental.&quot;\n Taking this idea of relativism to his parents' home in the North of England, Harrison committed to write a song based on the first words he saw upon opening a random book. Those first words were &quot;gently weeps&quot;, and he immediately began the song.\n The song was ranked #135 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest songs of all time.\n The song was also ranked #7 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;'s list of the 100 greatest guitar songs of all time.\n \n George Harrison \u2013 double-tracked vocal, backing vocal, guitar, Hammond organ \n John Lennon \u2013 guitar \n Paul McCartney \u2013 backing vocal, piano, organ, 6-string bass \n Ringo Starr \u2013 drums, tambourine \n Eric Clapton \u2013 lead guitar \n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; written by George Harrison for The Beatles on their double album The Beatles (also known as The White Album).\n George Harrison originally performed the song with a solo acoustic guitar and an organ; a demo version, longer than the officially released version, can be heard on the Anthology 3 album and in reworked form on the Love album.
