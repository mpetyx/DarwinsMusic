A woman sits on a settee and writes a note during the instrumental beginning. Davey Havok begins singing, eyes closed and hands folded, opening his eyes on the first &quot;sleep&quot; of the verse. The rest of the band is seen entering a large circular hall and setting up their instruments. Havok is sitting at a table, singing to the camera. At the end of Prelude 12/21, the woman, whose face cannot be seen, eats the note. Havok pulls it out of his mouth, reads it, and looks up to sing Miss Murder. As he sings, he walks out of the room and stands on a balcony in front of a huge crowd. The video cuts between him and the woman walking, holding a black rabbit. When the woman enters the courtyard, Havok sees her and there are shots of him inside, facing a mirror. A rabbit comes close to the chair, and he picks it up. There is another shot of him outside, with four banners featuring the members of the band on the wall. At the very end, he is facing the mirror again and the woman, presumably &quot;Miss Murder,&quot; touches the back of his neck and he closes his eyes again. The last shot is of the rabbit.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "This song appears on Guitar Hero 3.  &quot;Miss Murder&quot; is the first single from American rock band AFI's seventh studio album, Decemberunderground. &quot;Miss Murder&quot; was released on April 24, 2006 with the U.S. release of Decemberunderground on June 6, 2006.
