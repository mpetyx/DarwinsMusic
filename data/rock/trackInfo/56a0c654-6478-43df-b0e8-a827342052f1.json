Normal guitar solo. Normal drumming. Normal rock vocals. \r\n\r\nIf they pulled a U2 and went back to being a straight ahead rock band, I think they'd pull it off better than U2 did. And that's a high bar (of course, they pulled off the complete left turn into electronic music 1000 times better than U2).", "my favorite track from Pablo Honey", "worse than creep", "YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEH, YEEEEEEEH, YEH YEH YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH", ":)", "great song.
