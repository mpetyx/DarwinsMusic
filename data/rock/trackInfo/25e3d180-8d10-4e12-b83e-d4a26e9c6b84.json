This rock ballad was written by guitarist <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+May\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Brian May</a>, who played piano as well as guitar on the track. It was recorded in 1979 and released in the U.K. on January 25th, 1980, nearly six months prior to the release of the album It spent six weeks on the UK charts, peaking at number eleven. The song was played live from 1979-1984.\n \n Brian May wrote &quot;Save Me&quot; about a friend whose relationship had ended, and played piano, synths and guitars (electric and twelve-string acoustic) on it.\n \n Played live, the song would typically feature a short piano introduction absent from the studio version. This introduction can be found in a Brian May solo composition &quot;My Boy&quot; which can only be found much later on the 1998 compilation album &quot;Lullabies With A Difference&quot;. The general melody could have been conceived by May as early as 1980 as the intro to the live version of &quot;Save Me&quot; exhibits.\n \n In addition, the lyrics &quot;I'm naked and I'm far from home&quot; were uttered near the end of the pilot episode of the television series &quot;Highlander&quot; (whose theme was another Queen song, &quot;Princes of the Universe&quot;) by Christopher Lambert's character.\n \n In 2009, May assisted in the recording of a newl version to be featured on the website of his <a href=\"http://www.save-me.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Save Me</a> campaign, with <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kerry+Ellis\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Kerry Ellis</a> on lead vocals. \n \n The website states:\n &quot;Use your vote to ensure that the present laws protecting animals from cruelty are kept in place, more carefully monitored, legally tightened up, and fully enforced.&quot;\n \n     * Brian May: lead, rhythm and acoustic twelve-string guitars, piano, synthesizer, backing vocals.\n     * Roger Taylor: Drums, backing vocals.\n     * Freddie Mercury: Lead and backing vocals.\n     * John Deacon: bass.\n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Save Me&quot; is a song by English rock band Queen on their 1980 album release <a title=\"Queen - The Game\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/The+Game\" class=\"bbcode_album\">The Game</a>.
