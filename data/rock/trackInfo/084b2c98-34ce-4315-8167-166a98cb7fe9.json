It continued the group's popularity on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at #13, though not as successful as their ballad &quot;Blurry&quot;. It also topped the Mainstream Rock Tracks. The song peaked at #14 in the UK Singles Chart, making it the group's third Top 20 hit.\n \n &quot;She Hates Me&quot; is about the disillusionment that can come as a relationship goes on. Wes Scantlin was at the time just out of a relationship, and he wrote this, inspired from the anger. This song gives upbeat music to lyrics about his break-up. The chord progression is similar to the main chord progression in Suicidal Tendencies' &quot;I Saw Your Mommy&quot;, which has led to accusations that Puddle of Mudd &quot;ripped off&quot; that song. \n \n In the album's insert is a photocopy of each song's original hand written lyrics. It shows the original name of this song, which is &quot;She Fucking Hates Me&quot;.\n \n The song is featured in the movie My Super Ex-Girlfriend, and in the game Alvin and the Chipmunks.\n \n Covers and parodies\n \n Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine covered this as a lounge style on his 2002 album Tuxicity. Scala &amp; Kolacny Brothers Belgian girls' choir covered this song on their 2002 album On the Rocks.\n \n It was the subject of a parody entitled &quot;Internet Love Song (She Blocked Me)&quot; by Bob Ricci. This has become one of Ricci's most recognised songs.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;She Hates Me&quot; was released in 2002.
