The song reached the number five spot on both the Mainstream and Modern Rock Billboard charts. &quot;Jeremy&quot; was included on Pearl Jam's greatest hits album, <a title=\"Pearl Jam - rearviewmirror (greatest hits 1991-2003)\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pearl+Jam/rearviewmirror+(greatest+hits+1991-2003)\" class=\"bbcode_album\">rearviewmirror (greatest hits 1991-2003)</a>.\n \n The song especially gained notoriety by way of its music video (directed by Mark Pellington and released in 1992), which was put into heavy rotation by MTV and became a hit. In 1993, the &quot;Jeremy&quot; video was awarded four MTV Video Music Awards, including Best Video of the Year.\n \n The song is in the key of A, and intertwines the parallel modes of major and minor frequently. It features prominent usage of Ament's 12-string Hamer bass guitar, which is pivotal to the sound of the introduction and end of the recording. The song starts off with the bassline and quiet harmonic notes also on the 12-string bass, and continues in a sedate vein until after the second chorus, when densely layered guitars and vocals gradually enter. At the end the instruments gradually fade out until all that is audible is a clean guitar and the 12-string bass, like the intro. Both instruments play a descending minor key melody, fading out with one single note.\n \n The song takes its main inspiration from a newspaper article about a 15-year-old boy named Jeremy Wade Delle, born February 10, 1975, from Richardson, Texas who shot himself in front of his English class at Richardson High School on the morning of January 8, 1991 at about 9:45 am. Delle was described by schoolmates as &quot;real quiet&quot; and known for &quot;acting sad.&quot; After coming in to class late that morning, Delle was told to get an admittance slip from the school office. He left the classroom, and returned with a .357 Magnum revolver. Delle walked to the front of the classroom, announced &quot;Miss, I got what I really went for&quot;, put the barrel of the firearm in his mouth, and pulled the trigger before his teacher or classmates could react. A girl named Lisa Moore knew Jeremy from the in-school suspension program: &quot;He and I would pass notes back and forth and he would talk about life and stuff,&quot; she said. &quot;He signed all of his notes, 'Write back.' But on Monday he wrote, 'Later days.' I didn't know what to make of it. But I never thought this would happen.&quot;\n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Jeremy&quot; is a song by the American band <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pearl+Jam\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Pearl Jam</a>.
