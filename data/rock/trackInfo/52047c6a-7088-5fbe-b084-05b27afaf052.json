He loved him so much, he meant so much to him. He doesn't sing 'I'm so sorry for you are gone, please, come back', but he sings about all good things he did, about how an amazing person he was. In this song, he doesn't sing he regrets all those things he will never do with him, he is glad for what they experienced together. \r\nThat's why this song always makes me cry, it's the best song about friendship I have ever heard.", "So glad I met you to walk the line <3", "Pra mim \u00e9 a melhor do \u00e1lbum.", "Only truly decent song on I'm With You.", "Muito massa essa m\u00fasica!
