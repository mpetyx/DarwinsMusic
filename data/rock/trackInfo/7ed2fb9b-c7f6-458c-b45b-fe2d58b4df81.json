The song is released as a single from their third album Make Yourself. It is considered to be the band's biggest hit and breakthrough single, eventually reaching the top of Billboard's modern rock charts on March 3, 2001 and #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 on July 28. The music video is based on M.C. Escher's Drawing Hands and Gerrit van Dijk's animated film I Move, So I Am (Holland, 1997).The song is featured in the films Is It College Yet? and Surf's Up. It is a playable track in the North American and European versions of the video game Donkey Konga 2, it as well is featured in the game Karaoke Revolution Party and as downloadable content in the games Guitar Hero World Tour and SingStar.\n The music video by Phil Harder is a simple musical session intercut with an animation of Brandon Boyd drawing himself (the beginning of which is reminiscent of Drawing Hands, a lithograph work by Dutch artist M.C. Escher). Many scenes were shot in the McNamara Alumni Center on the University of Minnesota campus and in Bairnsdale, Victoria, Australia. The music video was nominated for Best Group Video at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards, but lost to 'N Sync.\n According to lead singer Brandon Boyd: &quot;The lyric is basically about fear, about being driven all your life by it and making decisions from fear. It's about imagining what life would be like if you didn't live it that way.&quot;Boyd and drummer Jose Pasillas drew all the artwork for the video. It took them more than 50 hours to do it\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Drive&quot; is a song by American rock band Incubus.
