Harrison's album was in fact a soundtrack to the film Wonderwall, but the film has remained unknown by the general public. The original title of the track was &quot;Wishing Stone&quot;.\n \n It is often claimed that &quot;Wonderwall&quot; was written for Gallagher's then-girlfriend, Meg Mathews. Gallagher married Mathews in 1997, but the couple divorced four years later. Gallagher now claims that the song was not about Mathews at all, but he felt he had to go along with the rumour, saying &quot;The meaning of that song was taken away from me by the media who jumped on it. How do you tell your Mrs it's not about her once she's read it is? It's a song about an imaginary friend who's gonna come and save you from yourself.&quot;\n \n In 2008 Liam Gallagher was quoted as saying about the song: &quot;I can't fucking stand that fucking song! Every time I have to sing it I want to gag. Problem is, it was a big, big tune for us.&quot;\n \n The song is included on <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Oasis</a>' compilation album <a title=\"Oasis - Stop The Clocks.\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/Stop+The+Clocks.\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Stop The Clocks.</a>\n \n     * In the Grammy Awards of 1997 the band received a nomination for Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group and Noel Gallagher picked another nomination for Best Rock Song, winning none.\n \n     * In May 2005, &quot;Wonderwall&quot; was voted the best British song of all time, in a poll of over 8,500 listeners conducted by Virgin Radio. \n \n     * In August 2006, &quot;Wonderwall&quot; was named the second-greatest song of all time in a poll conducted by Q Magazine, finishing behind another Oasis song, &quot;Live Forever&quot;.\n \n     * In 2006, U2's guitarist The Edge named &quot;Wonderwall&quot; one of the songs he most wishes he'd written.\n \n     * In May 2007, NME magazine placed &quot;Wonderwall&quot; at number 27 in its list of the 50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever.\n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Wonderwall&quot; is a song by British <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/rock\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">rock</a> band <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Oasis</a>, written by the band's guitarist and chief songwriter <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Noel+Gallagher\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Noel Gallagher</a>.
