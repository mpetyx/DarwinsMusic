At 8 minutes and 57 seconds, it is a rock ballad in the tradition of <a title=\"Led Zeppelin &ndash; Stairway to Heaven\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin/_/Stairway+to+Heaven\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Stairway to Heaven</a>, <a title=\"Lynyrd Skynyrd &ndash; Free Bird\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Lynyrd+Skynyrd/_/Free+Bird\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Free Bird</a>, and <a title=\"Queen &ndash; Bohemian Rhapsody\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/_/Bohemian+Rhapsody\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Bohemian Rhapsody</a>. It is the second-longest song on that album, the longest being the 10-minute <a title=\"Guns N' Roses &ndash; Coma\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Guns+N%27+Roses/_/Coma\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Coma</a>. Its distinct symphonic overtone owes to a sweeping synthesized string arrangement, played by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Axl+Rose\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Axl Rose</a>. Most live performances during the <em>Use Your Illusion</em> tour lacked the orchestral backing of the song (the 1992 <em>MTV Video Music Awards</em> being the best-known exception). It is the longest song to reach the top 10 of the <em>Billboard</em> Hot 100. The song peaked at #3 on the chart, becoming the band's sixth and last Top 10 hit and eighth and last top 40 hit to date. On the radio, <strong>&quot;November Rain&quot;</strong> is sometimes played in a shortened version of approximately six minutes, but many rock stations continue to play the full version. This song is listed at number 6 in <em>&quot;The 100 Greatest Guitar Solos&quot;</em> by <a href=\"http://www.guitarworld.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Guitar World</a>. <strong>&quot;November Rain&quot;</strong> was voted #1 on the <em>Rock 1000</em> 2006, an annual countdown of the top 1,000 rock songs by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/place/New+Zealand\" class=\"bbcode_place\">New Zealand</a> radio listeners. It was almost voted #1 on the <em>Rock 1000</em> 2007, but was beaten out by <a title=\"AC/DC &ndash; Back in Black\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/AC%2FDC/_/Back+in+Black\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Back in Black</a> by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/AC%2FDC\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">AC/DC</a>. \n \n Axl started to write this Song back in the 1983 and it was the only Song he could play on Piano at that point here is a quote from L.A Guns Guitarist Tracii Guns. &quot;When we were doing that EP for L.A. Guns, like in 1983, he was playing November Rain on piano. Way back then. It was the only thing Axl knew how to play, but it was his. He'd go: 'Someday this song is gonna be really cool.' And I'd go: 'It's cool now. But it's not done, you know.' And like anytime we'd be at a hotel or anywhere there'd be a piano, he'd just kinda play that music. And I'd go: 'When are you gonna finish that already, you know?' And he'd go: 'I don't know what to do with it.'\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;November Rain&quot; is a single by the band <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Guns+N%27+Roses\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Guns N' Roses</a>, written by lead singer <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Axl+Rose\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Axl Rose</a> and released in June 1992.
