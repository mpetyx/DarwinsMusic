It was a live favourite from the 2002 tour up to and including the 2005 tour.\n \n Interpretation 1: The song is about the idea of selling &quot;propaganda&quot; to mankind, to help them forget on what's happening around them or &quot;the small print&quot; on the contract. It's the beginning of the end, and it's taking advantage of humankind, is what this is about. The worshipping of false idols (like evil dictators, or whomever runs the government). If you do know the truth, you will be labeled as being &quot;insane&quot;, because only the government knows the truth and they &quot;bend it&quot;.\n \n Interpretation 2: This seems like it is sung from the point of view of a pop star, or generally representing the pop industry. Why? Because what sells for \u00a315 pounds a year - a CD or maybe DVD release. Think of any cynical music personality who you suspect is just in it for the money, and whose songs have no real truths in them. (There are a number of examples where Matt seems to adopt another persona, rather than just always singing from his own perspective).\n \n Interpretation 3: While initially played before Absolution's release, it went by the name 'Action Faust.'  The song can be understood as, clearly alluding to Goethe's ''Faust,'' being sung from the point of view of the Devil to someone selling their soul to him in exchange for, presumably, musical prowess and fame.  It shows the transaction as ultimately manipulative on the part of the Devil, dooming the recipient to be a &quot;slave to the grave&quot; and robbing him of all memories of &quot;the good days&quot;.  The Devil's identity can be seen in the line &quot;I'm a priest God never paid&quot;; he is able to mediate supernatural power but does so outside of the service of God.  The final title &quot;The Small Print&quot; yet again underlies the motif of a dishonest contract between a Devil and Faustian figure.\n \n Trivia\n At 2:51, a cat can be heard meowing.\n \n Lyrics\n Take, take all you need\n And I'll compensate your greed\n With broken hearts\n Sell, I'll sell your memories\n For 15 pounds per year\n But just the good days\n \n Say, it'll make you insane\n And it's bending the truth\n You're to blame\n For all the life that you'll lose and\n You watch this space\n And I'm going all the way\n And be my slave to the grave\n I'm a priest God never paid\n \n Hope, I hope you've seen the light\n 'cause no one really cares\n They're just pretending\n Sell, and I'll sell your memories \n For 15 pounds per year\n But you can keep the bad days\n \n Say, it'll make you insane\n And I'm bending the truth\n You're to blame\n For all the life that you'll lose and\n You watch this space\n And I'm going all the way\n And be my slave to the grave\n I'm a priest God never paid\n \n Say, it'll make you insane\n And I'm bending the truth\n You're to blame\n For all the life that you'll lose and\n You watch this space\n And I'm going all the way\n And be my slave to the grave\n I'm a priest God never paid\n \n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Description\n A simple metal come heavy rock song.
