The song was released as a single in November 1967, and topped the charts in both the United States and Britain.\n Though the songwriting credit is Lennon/McCartney, it was written only by Paul McCartney.\n Alistair Taylor, who worked for the Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein, had asked McCartney how he wrote his songs, and McCartney took him into his dining room to give him a demonstration on his harmonium. He asked Taylor to shout the opposite of whatever he sang as he played the instrument\u2014black and white, yes and no, stop and go, hello and goodbye. Taylor later said, &quot;I wonder whether Paul really made up that song as he went along or whether it was running through his head already.&quot;\n Under the working title &quot;Hello Hello&quot;, the Beatles recorded the backing track on 2 October 1967, and added vocals and a guitar overdub on the 19th. After further overdubs of bass guitar and viola, recording was completed on the 2nd November, and mixing on the 6th.\n The final lines of the song, where the entire band sings &quot;Hela, hey-ba hello-a&quot; came spontaneously in the studio. McCartney said &quot;I remember the end bit where there's the pause and it goes 'Heba, heba hello'. We had those words and we had this whole thing recorded but it didn't sound quite right, and I remember asking Geoff Emerick if we could really whack up the echo on the tom-toms. And we put this echo full up on the tom-toms and it just came alive.&quot;\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; is a song written by Lennon/McCartney and first recorded by the English rock band The Beatles.
