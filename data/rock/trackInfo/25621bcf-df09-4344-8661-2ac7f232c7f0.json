Taken from the album of the same name, it is one of his best-known singles. Rolling Stone ranked the song 275th on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 2001, the RIAA's Songs of the Century placed the song 59th (out of 365). Lyrically, the song deals with the effects of the Vietnam War on Americans, although it is widely misinterpreted as a patriotic anthem.

Songfacts</a>, the original title was &quot;Vietnam.&quot; Director Paul Schrader sent Springsteen a script for a movie called Born In The U.S.A., about a Rock band struggling with life and religion. This gave Bruce the idea for the new title. Unfortunately for Schrader, when he was finally ready to make the movie in 1985, the title &quot;Born In The U.S.A.&quot; was too associated with the song. Springsteen helped him out however, providing the song &quot;Light Of Day,&quot; which became the new title for Schrader's movie and the feature song in the film. \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; is a 1984 song written and performed by Bruce Springsteen.
