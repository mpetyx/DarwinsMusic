He formed Deftones initially as a way to come to grips with his &quot;Inner Black Beauty&quot;.\n \n Music: The intro as well the verses are composed of low guitar and a bit loud drums and bass with keyboards effects driving into heavy choirs who expands every time that they arrive. &quot;Change&quot; would become one of the most well known songs by Deftones.\n \n Meaning: &quot;It's a metaphorical song. You could take it in the literal sense of me watching someone turn into a fly and taking them home with me and pulling of their wings and laughing. It spawns from me being a complete a--hole and getting the complete repercussion for it by having my life taken away.&quot; - Chino.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Change (In the House of Flies) was the first single from Deftones' third album White Pony, released in May 2000.
