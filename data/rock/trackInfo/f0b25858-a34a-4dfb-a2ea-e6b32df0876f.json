Like most all of Rage Against the Machine's songs, the song's lyrics discuss social inequality, proclaiming that &quot;landlords and power whores&quot; were going to &quot;burn&quot;. The intro riff was composed by Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello when he was playing with the band Lock Up, and, upon hearing it, they told him it was too &quot;heavy&quot;. The main riff is one composed by Funkadelic, for Alice In My Fantasies. However Funkadelic is rarely credited for it. A music video was released, depicting support for the Sendero Luminoso Maoist revolutionary group and it's leader Abimael Guzman. The single cover features a portrait of Che Guevara.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Bombtrack&quot; is the song by Rage Against the Machine that opens their self-titled debut album.
