A product of Bowie's fertile 'Berlin' period, life in the city was crystallized into a tale of two lovers who come together in the shadow of the 'Wall of Shame' (though here &quot;the shame was on the other side&quot;).

While not a huge hit at the time, the song has gone on to become one of Bowie's signature tunes and is well known today for its appearance in numerous advertisements. It has been cited as Bowie's second most covered song after <a title=\"David Bowie &ndash; Rebel Rebel\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie/_/Rebel+Rebel\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Rebel Rebel</a>.
