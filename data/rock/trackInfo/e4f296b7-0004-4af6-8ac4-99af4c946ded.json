McIlrath said of the song, &quot;I wanted to take the perspective of 'What is the war going to be looked back on as?'&quot; He went on to say, &quot;There are not many songs...talking about what's going on during eight years of occupation in Iraq. That, combined with meeting active soldiers and retired soldiers at our shows and hearing those stories about what is going on on the ground amid all the bullshit, showed me the differences from what is really happening to what is happening in the news media.
