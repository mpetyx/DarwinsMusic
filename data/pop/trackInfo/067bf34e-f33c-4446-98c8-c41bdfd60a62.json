The original version of the song was recorded that year by R&amp;B quartet All-4-One for the soundtrack album to the Warner Bros. film Space Jam. Three years later, American pop singer Christina Aguilera recorded a cover version, produced by Guy Roche, for her debut album, Christina Aguilera. Released in the spring of 2000 as the album's third single, the single peaked at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 for 4 weeks, becoming Aguilera's third Top 10 hit.\n \n Song information\n \n The lyrics of &quot;I Turn to You&quot; are an ode from the narrator to a person who helps them find the proverbial light in the rain when she is lost or losing ground. The single is written with the theme of thanking a parental figure (her mother) (as evidenced by the music video produced for Aguilera's version.) However, the song's lyrics are ambiguous enough to where the lyrics can apply to a lover, a friend, or another family member.\n \n The song was re-written in Spanish, and titled &quot;Por Siempre T\u00fa&quot; (English: Forever You), for Aguilera's first Spanish-language album, Mi Reflejo.\n \n Music Video\n \n The identity of the director of the videos for &quot;I Turn to You&quot; and &quot;Por siempre t\u00fa&quot; remains somewhat of a mystery. At the time of the videos' release, MTV had the director listed as Rupert C. Almont. However, the inlay for the DVD Deluxe Editon of Keeps Gettin' Better - A Decade of Hits lists the director as Richard C. Allen. It is likely that both are simply pseudonyms for top director Joseph Kahn, as it was Kahn who appeared as director on the episode of Making the Video that chronicled the making of this music video.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;I Turn to You&quot; is a pop ballad written by Diane Warren in 1996.
