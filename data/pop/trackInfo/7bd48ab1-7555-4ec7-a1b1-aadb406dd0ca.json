But I liked the West (Indies) influence that the music had. I just went in the booth and they were already jotting down some ideas and that (the hook) came to me. The hook &quot;rude boy&quot; was just supposed to be the intro. But it was so catchy we that we just made it the hook. &quot;</span>\n \n Rihanna has also told Q magazine the song is &quot;<em>about the kind of street, bad boy that girls sometimes like</em>.&quot;\n \n The video was directed by music video director <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melina_Matsoukas\" rel=\"nofollow\">Melina Matsoukas</a> in January 2010 in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California and was shot in a greenscreen. Matsoukas previously directed Rihanna's &quot;<a title=\"Rihanna &ndash; Hard\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/Hard\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Hard</a>&quot; music video. Rihanna said that the video is completely different from any other video she's shot before, describing it as &quot;<em>pretty freakin' cool</em>&quot;. She added: &quot;<em>A lot of my videos are really dark and edgy and tough. 'Rude Boy' is more playing along the lines from my roots. We used a lot of color, but also the costumes were very Jamaican dance-hall queen type</em>&quot;.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Rude Boy&quot; is the second international single, and the third US single from Rihanna's fourth album <a title=\"Rihanna - Rated R\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/Rated+R\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Rated R</a>.
