To date, &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot; is Shakira's third most successful single worldwide, behind only &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; (2001) and &quot;Hips Don't Lie&quot; (2006).\n \n &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot; is a love song with lyrics by Shakira and music by her and Lester Mendez. It tells the story of the unconditional love that a woman has for her boyfriend, which is referenced in the lyrics.\n \n The song is clearly heavily influenced by the 80s hit &quot;Eternal Flame&quot; by The Bangles, written by songwriters Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly.\n \n &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot; is listed on #391 on Blender's &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born&quot; list.\n \n The music video for &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot; was directed by American photographer Herb Ritts and it was the second to last he directed before his death. It starts with a black-and-white scene of a reporter asking Shakira how she feels about crossing over into the English-speaking music market, and the singer, ironically, answers him in Spanish. Shakira claimed in her &quot;MTV Making the Video&quot; of the song that the &quot;Crossover&quot; claims had been her daily bread, and that she heavily wished for this to be included into the video. The video illustrates her loneliness as a music artist when she goes on tour. Then, scenes of the singer performing the song live with her band and passionately hugging her boyfriend (played by her real-life fianc\u00e9 Antonio de la R\u00faa) are shown.\n \n &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot; was the second video by Shakira to retire on MTV's TRL on May 14, 2002, when it was at #3 on the countdown.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot; is a song by Colombian singer-songwriter Shakira - the second English language single released from Laundry Service (2001).
