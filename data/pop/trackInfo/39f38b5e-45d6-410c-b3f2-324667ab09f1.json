Priscilla Renea wrote the song with Emanuel Kiriakou, who produced the track. The song was released on March 2011, as the lead single from the band's third album, When the Sun Goes Down (2011). According to Gomez, the song was intended to inspire people, and fire back at the &quot;haters&quot;, particularly those involved in cyberbullying. &quot;Who Says&quot; marks a distinct departure in sound for the band, as it has an acoustic and organic feel, compared to their dance-pop and club-oriented previous singles. The song is a teen pop number with inspirational lyrics about embracing yourself and not letting anyone bring you down.\n \n Selena told Ryan Seacrest during the song's preview: &quot;When I heard it, I felt like my fans need this song right now, especially with Twitter and Facebook. I feel like it's really negative for me. Within that world, there's just such easy access to people's feelings. This song is such a great message to my fans, and it really touched me when I heard it.&quot;\n She added: &quot;Basically, it's to the haters, it's to the people who try to bring you down.&quot; (Source <a href=\"http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=22212\" rel=\"nofollow\">Who Says Songfacts</a>).\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Who Says&quot; is a song performed by American band Selena Gomez &amp; the Scene.
