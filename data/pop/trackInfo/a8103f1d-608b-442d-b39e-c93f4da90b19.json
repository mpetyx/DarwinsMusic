Wayne Wilkins, Louis Biancaniello and Sam Watters also co-wrote the song.\n \n Sparks told Digital Spy about the recording of the song: &quot;What grabbed me at first actually was the fact it was so big. The melody starts off very soft but then it gets massive and kinda angsty. I've had lots of friends who've gone through 'Battlefield' situations in their relationships, so when I was singing the song I put myself in their position and tried to imagine what they were going through. I got so, so into it and I think you can tell.&quot; (Source <a href=\"http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=15721\" rel=\"nofollow\">Battlefield Songfacts</a>).\n \n Jordin performed &quot;Battlefield&quot; on American Idol Season 8 Top 3 Result Show on May 13, 2009.\n \n The single has received a very positive response so far, all generating from online forums and blogs. Pop Justice raves:\n &quot;To start with you think 'this isn't up to much' then by the end of it you think 'this is going to be Number One for precisely 2.5 months'. There is a brilliant middle eight where everything falls out and it's just Jordin bellowing &quot;like a battlefield! Like a battlefield!&quot; and then it all crashes back in and then it all falls out again and then it all goes back in again and it's all jolly good.&quot;\n \n New York Post said &quot;the single is simply pure pop magic.&quot;\n \n \n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Battlefield&quot; is the lead single from Grammy-nominated American R&amp;B artist Jordin Sparks' sophomore studio album, which is due to be released July 14, 2009.
