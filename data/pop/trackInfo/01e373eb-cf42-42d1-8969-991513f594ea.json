It was originally written in 1973, in honor of Marilyn Monroe, who had died 11 years earlier.\n \n In 1997, John performed a remake of the song as a tribute to Diana, Princess of Wales. This version of the song was released as a single, and reached No. 1 in many countries, proving a much greater success than the original.\n \n The original version in the key of E major appeared on John's 1973 album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. The lyrics of the song are a sympathetic portrayal of the life of Marilyn Monroe (the song's opening line &quot;Goodbye Norma Jean&quot; refers to Monroe's real name). The single release of the original song reached #11 in the U.K. charts in 1974. At the time, it was not released as a single in the United States (&quot;Bennie and the Jets&quot; was chosen instead). Taupin was inspired to write the song after hearing the phrase &quot;candle in the wind&quot; used in tribute to Janis Joplin.\n \n In 1987, a live version of the song recorded for the album <em><a title=\"Elton John - Live In Australia With The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Elton+John/Live+In+Australia+With+The+Melbourne+Symphony+Orchestra\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Live In Australia With The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra</a></em> was released as a single. This version was released in the United States and reached #6 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also reached #5 in the United Kingdom.\n \n &quot;<a title=\"Elton John &ndash; Candle In The Wind 1997\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Elton+John/_/Candle+In+The+Wind+1997\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Candle In The Wind 1997</a>&quot; or &quot;Goodbye England's Rose&quot; is a remake of &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot; as a tribute to Diana, Princess of Wales. The opening lines of the 1973 version, &quot;Goodbye Norma Jean, though I never knew you at all,&quot; were adapted to &quot;Goodbye England's rose, may you ever grow in our hearts.&quot; In fact, most of the lyrics were adapted to suit the circumstances of Diana's life and death: one notable omission was the line &quot;Even when you died, the Press still hounded you&quot;.\n \n Released in 1997, the song peaked at No. 1 in the United Kingdom, becoming John's fourth No. 1 single. It also peaked at No. 1 in several other countries. The Guinness Book of Records 2007 states that &quot;Candle In the Wind 1997&quot; is the biggest-selling single &quot;since records began,&quot; but that Bing Crosby's &quot;White Christmas&quot; has sold the most copies. John said he would never again sing this version live except at the request of Harry or William Windsor.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Candle in the Wind&quot; is a song with music by Elton John and lyrics by Bernie Taupin.
