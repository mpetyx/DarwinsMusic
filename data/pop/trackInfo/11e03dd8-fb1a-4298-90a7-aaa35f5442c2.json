The original recording by Williams proved to be his greatest commercial success, being certified 2x Platinum in the United Kingdom and selling 2 million worldwide.\n \n &quot;Angels&quot; was the fourth single from Robbie Williams' debut album, Life Thru a Lens. It has been credited with saving the singer's solo career, and is used to conclude almost all of his concerts.\n \n At the 2005 BRIT Awards, &quot;Angels&quot; was voted by the British public the best song in the past twenty-five years of British music, though it had only reached number four on the singles chart. Williams performed the song live with <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Joss+Stone\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Joss Stone</a> then. In a survey by UK digital TV station Music Choice, it even came in at number one as the song people would most like played at their funeral.\n \n It was released in 1999 in the U.S., after his debut of &quot;<a title=\"Robbie Williams &ndash; Millennium\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Robbie+Williams/_/Millennium\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Millennium</a>.&quot; The U.S. released video has Williams atop a roof, watching the city below. On 12 April, 2008 it was at #1 on the U.S. iTunes primarily due to the performance of the song by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/David+Archuleta\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">David Archuleta</a> on American Idol earlier that week. After an 8 year absence on the chart, &quot;Angels&quot; re entered the ARIA Top 100 at 91, on May 5 2008.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Angels&quot; is a song written by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Robbie+Williams\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Robbie Williams</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Guy+Chambers\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Guy Chambers</a>.
