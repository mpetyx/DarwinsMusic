She regrets having allowed herself to be vulnerable to him (opened up and let you in / you made me feel alright for once in my life), and has resolved that no matter how much she is actually hurting, he will not get the satisfaction of seeing her cry (you won't get to see the tears I cry / behind these hazel eyes). \n \n The single was successful, peaking at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100, #9 in the UK, #4 in Canada, #6 in Australia, #7 in New Zealand and #4 in Ireland. \n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Behind These Hazel Eyes&quot; is a pop-rock song written by Max Martin, Dr. Luke and Kelly Clarkson and produced by Max Martin and Dr. Luke.
