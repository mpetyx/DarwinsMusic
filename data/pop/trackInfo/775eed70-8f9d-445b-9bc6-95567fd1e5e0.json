It was released on August 8, 2000 through Jive Records as the second single from the album. The teen pop song is about a famous pop star, who despite being very &quot;lucky&quot; and seemingly having it all \u2013 fame, wealth, beauty and so on \u2013 is truly lonely on the inside.\n \n &quot;Lucky&quot; achieved commercial success, reaching the top position in Austria, Europe, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland, while making into the top ten on eleven charts around the world. In the United States, the song was expected to reach number one[citation needed], but peaked at number 23 in the Hot 100, and at number nine in the Pop Songs chart. &quot;Lucky&quot; received several certifications around the world, from Silver to Platinum. An accompanying music video, directed by Dave Meyers, portrays Spears as a famous actress called Lucky, who shows the same feelings described on the song.\n \n In 1999, Spears started to work on her second studio album, Oops!...I Did It Again (2000), in Sweden and Switzerland, with Max Martin and producers such as Robert Lange. &quot;Lucky&quot; was written and produced by Martin and Rami, while additional writing was done by Alexander Kronlund.
