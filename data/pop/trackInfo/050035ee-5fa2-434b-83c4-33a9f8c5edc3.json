Blunt teamed up with American songwriters Ryan Tedder and Steve Robson to pen the track.\n According to the <a href=\"http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=21057\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stay The Night Songfacts</a>, it marked the first time Blunt has written with two other songwriters in the same room or started a song from scratch.\n \n The single received an exclusive advance-release in Austria on September 10, 2010. The single was released on October 25, 2010.  \n \n &quot;Stay the Night&quot; was first written after Blunt stated he was &quot;tired of writing self-pitying songs&quot;. In an interview for STV, Blunt claimed: &quot;After the last tour I tried writing at the piano, but I was repeating myself, writing sad songs about poor old me. I needed to get away from music for a while. My new songs, most prominently 'Stay the Night', are more optimistic. One thing I did learn is that your artistic credibility goes out the window when you have a big record. 'You're Beautiful' meant something to me, but to most people, it's a song they sing when they're drunk.&quot;\n \n The lyrics in &quot;Stay the Night&quot; feature a reference to Bob Marley's classic &quot;Is This Love&quot; in the lines: Just like the song on our radio set / We\u2019ll share the shelter of my single bed. Marley is credited as a co-writer.\n \n Blunt performed the song live for the first time at the Help for Heroes Charity Concert in Twickenham  on September 12, 2010.  Ryan Brockington of the New York Post has called the song &quot;very chipper and up-tempo&quot;, comparing it in sound to that of the band Train.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Stay the Night&quot; is the lead single from English singer-songwriter James Blunt's third studio album, Some Kind of Trouble.
