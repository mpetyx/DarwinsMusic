It was released as the second single from her upcoming seventh studio album, Femme Fatale. &quot;Till the World Ends&quot; was written by Alexander Kronlund, Kesha, Dr. Luke and Max Martin, while being produced by Dr. Luke, Max Martin and Billboard. The main inspiration of the song for Kesha was imagining Spears and any other female musician touring the world. &quot;Till the World Ends&quot; was leaked on March 3, 2011, and Spears premiered it the following day at Ryan Seacrest's radio show. Musically, the song is a dance-oriented number with a chant-like chorus and breathy vocals, and lyrics that talk about dancing until the end of the world.\n \n According to the <a href=\"http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=22282\" rel=\"nofollow\">Til The World Ends Songfacts</a>, a pre-famous <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ke$ha\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Ke$ha</a> previously worked with Britney on her track <a title=\"Britney Spears &ndash; Lace and Leather\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Britney+Spears/_/Lace+and+Leather\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Lace and Leather</a>. \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Till the World Ends&quot; is a song by American recording artist Britney Spears.
