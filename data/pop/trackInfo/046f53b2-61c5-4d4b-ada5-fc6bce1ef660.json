A number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100, the song was also the number-one R&amp;B single for nine weeks in the United States and is one of Jackson's most critically acclaimed songs. It was voted best single of the year in The Village Voice Jazz &amp; Pop critics' poll, and received two Grammy Awards in 1984 in the categories Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance and Best New Rhythm &amp; Blues Song. It was nominated for Record of the Year and Song of the Year, along with &quot;Beat It&quot;, at the Grammy Awards of 1984. In 2005, Blender magazine recognized <a title=\"Michael Jackson &ndash; Billie Jean\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson/_/Billie+Jean\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Billie Jean</a> as the greatest song since 1980. It's also his best-selling single worldwide, with 5.25 million copies sold, and contributed to the immense sales of the album <a title=\"Michael Jackson - Thriller\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson/Thriller\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Thriller</a>.\n \n Jackson started writing the first demo of the song in his home in Wilson, North Carolina in the fall of 1981. When he presented the song to his co-producer <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Quincy+Jones\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Quincy Jones</a>, Jones had problems with the title and wanted to call the song &quot;Not My Lover&quot;. He thought when audiences heard it they would assume Jackson was referring to tennis superstar Billie Jean King. He also had complaints about the length of the song's intro, believing it was too long; Jackson replied that the long intro made him want to dance. Jackson won both arguments: he got to keep the title of the song and the intro.\n \n The introduction of the character Billie Jean is foreshadowed by a four-line reference from the album's first track <a title=\"Michael Jackson &ndash; Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson/_/Wanna+Be+Startin%27+Somethin%27\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'</a>, another Jackson-penned song. In the third verse, it's evident that Billie Jean doesn't have the singer's best interests at heart, &quot;tellin' lies and rubbin' shoulders,&quot; but her dismissal is casual: &quot;So they called her mouth a motor.&quot; However, coupled with her appearance on the second side of the album, the listener is made privy to the earliest of Jackson's lyrics to deal with the subject of celebrity suspicion of those in their periphery (media, groupies, etc.). This marked a subtle but important occasional shift in the entertainer's material toward somewhat more adult themes.\n \n Jackson is said to have recorded his lead vocal performance on the first take. But it was Jackson's arrangements and orchestration in &quot;Billie Jean&quot; that helped make the song unique. Jackson had wanted to write &quot;the perfect bass line&quot; and has said he worked on it for a couple of weeks until he succeeded with what became the basis of the final product. He had also arranged the drum and synthesizer lines into perfect order, and with help from co-collaborator Jerry Hey on the strings and horns and Jackson's mastery at multi-tracking his voice for background vocals, completed the final production on &quot;Billie Jean&quot; only weeks before <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/label/Epic\" class=\"bbcode_label\">Epic</a>'s scheduled release of the Thriller album on November 30, 1982. &quot;Billie Jean&quot; officially became the second single from Thriller when it was released in January 1983.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "<a title=\"Michael Jackson &ndash; Billie Jean\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson/_/Billie+Jean\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Billie Jean</a> is a 1983 hit single from <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Michael Jackson</a>'s <a title=\"Michael Jackson - Thriller\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson/Thriller\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Thriller</a> album.
