The video featured Minogue lying next to a swimming pool surrounded by a semi-naked 'cast' striking various poses whilst lying down on their backs or on their sides. &quot;Slow&quot; has been performed on many of Minogue's concert tours, including Showgirl: The Greatest Hits Tour and her KylieX2008 tour. Minogue has named &quot;Slow&quot; as her favorite song that she has recorded. The single's music video, directed by Baillie Walsh, was shot over a three-day period in the Spanish city of Barcelona, at the Piscina Municipal de Montju\u00efc. The first two days of shooting were postponed due to heavy rain, but the video was completed by the end of the third day. The video opens with a man diving into a swimming pool from a diving board from where the skyscrapers of Barcelona can be clearly seen. After the man gets out the pool, the rest of the video focuses on Minogue, who is amongst a crowded poolside of swimwear-clad men and women. There are various side-views and bird's-eye views of Minogue as she sings the song.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Slow&quot; is a song performed by Australian recording artist and songwriter Kylie Minogue taken from her ninth studio album Body Language (2003).
