The background vocals with the richness of the rythmic strings and the echo from the light angelic sound of the tender soprano blending with the lower slightly darker vocals that is Annie Lennox gifted forte, melts  into a rhythmic almost heartbeat feel that  builds to a full synchronized sound reaching from a cool mountain top down to a lush warm valley of pure rocking soul.
