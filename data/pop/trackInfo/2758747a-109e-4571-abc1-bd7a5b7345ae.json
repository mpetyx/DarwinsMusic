So all I can say is great lyrics :)", "I first heard this song when I was 12, now I'm 22 and it still has my most favourite lyrics of all time <3 Miss Dido writing masterpieces like this.", "Anything she sings sounds great!!! (2) Where have I been all my life? Not being funny...I only found Dido when I stumbled onto last.fm. That speaks volumes about how pathetic radio in the U.S. has become...with corporate playlists. Dido is right at the top of a select few I would gladly hear anytime and would travel far to see. If you haven't seen the acoustic videos from her new album, treat youself...they are right here. My favorites are Dido - Girl Who Got Away (Acoustic) and Dido - No Freedom (Acoustic). The CD I ordered should be in my mitts by Friday. Can't wait.", "The lyrics are meaningful, and this song is pretty beautiful! [2] i love her voice...i love her music....she is great!!!", "I have often thought that I would love to live by the sea, to travel the world alone and live more simply, I have no idea what's happened to that dream . . .", "One of my most favorite songs of all time <3. Add me if we have Super musical compatibility ^^!", "It's just a thought. Only a thought... [2]", "Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuull.", "still being supreme", "Amazing song... It reaches my heart so easily.", "Amazing voice !!!!", "'Cos nothing I have is truly mine", "This song is so beautiful...", "So nice...", "This song is so beautiful. I love it.
