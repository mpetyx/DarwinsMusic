The video received a mixed response from critics, and they noted that the video strongly alludes to ex-boyfriend Chris Brown's assault on Rihanna.  \n \n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "The <a href=\"http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=24074\" rel=\"nofollow\">We Found Love Songfacts</a> says: Following a stint as her support act on the Australian leg of her tour, Calvin Harris was asked by Rihanna to write a song for her next album.
