However, the video that presently runs at the top of this web page is NOT that video!  This one only shows the band members standing around singing it.  The original MTV video began with a young girl listening to an old radio -- then she's transported to a laboratory with Trevor Horn (wearing a white lab coat) and a woman in glittering tights who come flying out of a plastic tube.  All mesmerizing stuff telling a story--like so many great MTV videos--not just showing the band playing.  Sadly, that classic original video is hard to come by now.", "Yes, Eye_Gore, the first!
