It peaked at #3 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and was certified Gold by the RIAA. It went to number one in Spain, Denmark, New Zealand, South Africa, Latvia, Australia, where it was certified 2x Platinum, and Canada, where it spent five weeks at number one on the Canadian RPM singles chart. &quot;Crush&quot; also reached the Top 5 in the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Hungary, and #6 in Ireland, The Netherlands and Norway.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Crush&quot; was written by Andy Goldmark, Mark Muller, Berny Cosgrove and Kevin Clark.
