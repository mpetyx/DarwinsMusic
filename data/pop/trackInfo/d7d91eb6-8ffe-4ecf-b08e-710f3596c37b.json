According to the <a href=\"http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=5026\" rel=\"nofollow\">Since U Been Gone Songfacts</a>, the song almost didn't make it onto the Breakaway album; when Clarkson heard the first, acoustic version of the tune, she didn't like it. It wasn't until it was given a rocking treatment that she warmed to the song. It was released in 2004 as the second single from the album in the U.S. and the first in Europe (see 2004 in music). Its lyrics recall a failed relationship in which the protagonist later expresses relief about the breakup. Clarkson, who sought interest in a more rock-oriented image, wanted to alter the song's original composition to allow more drums. The song has a punk-pop influence in drums and guitar riffs\n \n The song was successful during 2005 (see 2005 in music), and was the second U.S. digital download to sell over one million copies. It reached number two on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and the Canadian airplay chart. In the UK, where &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; was released as the first single from Breakaway, it reached number five and remained on the chart until the second quarter of 2006 (see 2006 in music). At the Grammy Awards of 2006, Clarkson received a Grammy Award for the song in the category of &quot;Best Female Pop Vocal Performance&quot;. Since U Been Gone charted at ninety-seven in &quot;Blender Magazine's&quot; 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born.\n \n Much of the song's melody and chords resemble those of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Strokes\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Strokes</a>' &quot;Barely Legal&quot; on their album Is This It. &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; writers Max Martin and Dr. Luke admitted on several occasions to being heavily influenced by The Strokes when writing the Clarkson song.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; is a song written and produced by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Max+Martin\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Max Martin</a> and Lukasz &quot;<a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+Luke\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Dr. Luke</a>&quot; Gottwald and recorded for American singer <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kelly+Clarkson\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Kelly Clarkson</a>'s second album, <a title=\"Kelly Clarkson - Breakaway\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kelly+Clarkson/Breakaway\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Breakaway</a> (2004).
