Released in 2004, the single peaked at #5 in the USA becoming Maroon 5's second Top 10 single; it also peaked at #4 in the UK. The song reached #1 in Australia and remained at the top for 5 non-consecutive weeks; it also peaked at #2 in Latin America becoming Maroon 5's second consecutive Top 3. The song also reached #1 on the world-wide chart. The single is noted for its music video which stars Kelly Preston.\n \n The song was inspired by the complicated relation between Maroon 5's vocalist, Adam Levine, and his ex-girlfriend, Jane. The song is one of the band's more melodic-sounding songs, with its instantly-recognisable bassline running parallel to the main textured guitar riff. In some versions of the song, including the UK release, the age of the girl in the lyrics is seventeen instead of eighteen.\n \n When the band was commissioned to perform at the AFI Life Achievement Award ceremony for George Lucas, this song was chosen in tribute to Lucas' children, mainly his oldest daughter.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;She Will Be Loved&quot; is the third single from the Californian band Maroon 5's 2002 debut album, Songs About Jane.
