The song was produced by Brian Kennedy with background vocals by Chris Brown and Andre Merritt. Contrary to popular belief, Rihanna uses an Auto-Tune, not a vocoder throughout the song. It was featured in a Circuit City commercial.\n \n The song was originally written by Chris Brown and his team known as the Graffiti Artizts and was considered for the re-release of his album Exclusive. However, Brown felt that the song would be better suited for a female singer. He then forwarded the song to Rihanna. Def Jam had considered saving the track for Rihanna's next album in 2009, because she had already recorded &quot;Take a Bow&quot; for the re-release of Good Girl Gone Bad. However, Rihanna and her team felt that the song was a summer single and needed to be recorded and released as soon as possible. The decision was finally made to release the song as the follow up to &quot;Take a Bow&quot;.\n \n The song follows in the footsteps of Rihanna's &quot;Don't Stop the Music&quot; by being a fast and upbeat pop/dance-rhythmic song. However, in contrast to the upbeat music of &quot;Don't Stop the Music&quot;, it is lyrically dark in tone, being about a state of mental anguish, delusional feelings and confusion.\n \n In the UK, although not yet released as a single, &quot;Disturbia&quot; debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number forty-seven and was expected to chart higher on the 27th July due to high downloads and the release of the video, but managed to re-enter at #47 again and then climbed to #34. It also debuted at number forty-five in Ireland and then rose to #7 and became its new peak.\n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Disturbia&quot; is a song written by Andre Merritt, Chris Brown and Robert Allen for the re-release of Rihanna's third studio album, Good Girl Gone Bad, and is the third single from the re-release, following &quot;Take a Bow&quot; and &quot;If I Never See Your Face Again&quot; and the seventh single from the original album.
