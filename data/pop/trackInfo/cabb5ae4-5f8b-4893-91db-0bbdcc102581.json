It won the 2007 Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. The song was released as the album's second single, and achieved major success worldwide.\n \n Despite the huge commercial success and relatively recent release of the album's first single &quot;SexyBack&quot;, radio stations in various cities across the U.S. began spinning the cut in mid-August 2006. In a similar fashion to &quot;SexyBack&quot;, Timbaland contributes limited background vocals to the song, and the song also features a rap verse from T.I.. Reception of the song has been very positive, with many fans and critics preferring it over &quot;SexyBack.&quot; The song received a rare 5/5 star rating from Pitchfork Media and was subsequently named their number one song of 2006. Timberlake performed &quot;My Love&quot; and &quot;SexyBack&quot; as a medley for the opening of the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards, and again for the MTV Europe Music Awards 2006, which he also hosted. He also performed the song on Saturday Night Live.\n \n Timberlake became the first male artist since Usher in 2004 to have two consecutive number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. The song became Timberlake's second number one single on the Hot 100, and T.I.'s first.\n \n &quot;My Love&quot; (also known as &quot;Let Me Talk to You/My Love&quot;) is Timberlake's second top 10 single in a row in the Latin America Top 40.\n \n In the iTunes Music Store, there are alternative versions of the single cover. The spot on the cover is different for each release:\n \n     * Red - Single &amp; Instrumental\n     * Green - My Love: The Remixes EP\n     * Blue - PodPak Single (with single version, a remix [Mike D Bass Mix], and music video)\n \n The music video, directed by Paul Hunter and shot in black and white, premiered on October 12, 2006. It includes the prelude to the song (&quot;Let Me Talk to You&quot;), which features the song's producer, Timbaland.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "My Love is a hit single co-written by Justin Timberlake, T.I., Nate Hills, and Timbaland for Timberlake's second studio album FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006).
