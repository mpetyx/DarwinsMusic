The single has so far reached number one in over 32 countries, including Australia, Japan, Canada, the United Kingdom,  and the United States.  According to the <a href=\"http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=9094\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bleeding Love Songfacts</a>, Lewis was the first British female solo act to top the US chart since Kim Wilde did so in 1986 with &quot;<a title=\"Kim Wilde &ndash; You Keep Me Hangin' On\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kim+Wilde/_/You+Keep+Me+Hangin%27+On\" class=\"bbcode_track\">You Keep Me Hangin' On</a>.&quot;\n McCartney's version of the song was released on some editions of his third album Departure. However record label boss Clive Davis heard the song and wanted it for Leona Lewis, who he was championing. McCartney said: &quot;We originally wrote the song for my record and then I guess Clive Davis heard it, called up and said, 'We really wanna use it for her album.'&quot;\n \n In December 2007, &quot;Bleeding Love&quot; won The Record of the Year and the award for Best Track in the Virgin Media Music Awards 2007.\n \n In January 2008, the song was nominated for the British Single award at the 2008 BRIT Awards. Although the award was won by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Take+That\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Take That</a>'s &quot;<a title=\"Take That &ndash; Shine\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Take+That/_/Shine\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Shine</a>&quot;, it was announced that &quot;Bleeding Love&quot; had received the second highest number of public votes. The massive success of &quot;Bleeding Love&quot; earned Lewis the music award at Britain's Best 2008, which was aired on ITV1 on Friday 23 May 2008.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Bleeding Love&quot; is a pop ballad written by Ryan Tedder of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/OneRepublic\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">OneRepublic</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jesse+McCartney\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Jesse McCartney</a> and produced by Tedder for British singer Leona Lewis's debut album, <a title=\"Leona Lewis - Spirit\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Leona+Lewis/Spirit\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Spirit</a>.
