She actually does a nice job with this song. The first time I heard this version was on our old jazz station in town, and it took me a minute to realize it was an old Cure song.", "KILL IT!!! KILL IT WITH FIRE!!! Seriously though, I can respect her musical ability, but I'm tired of hearing her everywhere I go, and I can't express through polite words how much I abhore that she was allowed near this song.", "I don't have anything against Adele, and though I am a massive Cure fangirl I don't feel like no one should be allowed to cover them / this song (I *love* Jack Off Jill's cover of Lovesong), but this really isn't very good at all.
