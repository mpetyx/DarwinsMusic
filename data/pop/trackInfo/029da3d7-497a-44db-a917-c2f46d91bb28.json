She told the story of the song to BBC DJ Steve Lamacq on his Radio 2 show: &quot;It came to be because myself and Finn decided we want to make a song, we're not even going to think about it. We sat down at the computer and suddenly Finn just came up with this drum thing and then a bass line and I came up with a vocal thing. It was one of those very rare moments that something just comes together without any kind of effort or any kind of thinking. It was probably the easiest song I've written, but actually when I listen back to the lyrics they are actually quite meaningful&quot;\n \n &quot;They are about a girl and a guy who are in a relationship but it's a very dark relationship in that its only based on being physical. Its not like a sexual song its more like shows that some relationships are based on nothing that is real, they are not based on something good. I've had that experience in my life, because you're trying to cling on to something that you know you're in denial. That's what the song is about in that you know the world won't bring us down, you can be as happy as Larry inside your house with your boyfriend or lover, but as soon as you step outside you're in the real world and you have to deal with it.&quot;\n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Under The Sheets&quot; was the first single from <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ellie+Goulding\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Ellie Goulding</a>'s debut album <a title=\"Ellie Goulding - Lights\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ellie+Goulding/Lights\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Lights</a>.
