Released in 2003, the single peaked at number twenty on the Billboard Hot 100, where it became Aguilera's ninth U.S. top-twenty single. &quot;Fighter&quot; also reached number three in the United Kingdom and Canada, and number five in Australia.\n \n &quot;Fighter&quot; was written by Aguilera and Scott Storch and produced by Storch. It features Dave Navarro on guitar. In her first single to bear elements of rock music, a seemingly dissatisfied Aguilera seems to bemoan and scream of a man who apparently did her wrong. However, in a surprising twist, she does not want to complain or insult him; in fact, she wants to thank him. Aguilera wrote the song about her father, who abandoned her family. The singer also explained, as quoted on the <a href=\"http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=435\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fighter Songfacts</a>, that another inspiration for the song was the way she was picked on and alienated when she was young because of her passion for music. \n \n &quot;Fighter&quot; is also one of Aguilera's most popular songs, as it became the official anthem for the 2003 NBA Playoffs and was heard daily during the NBA Finals commercials by millions of viewers. An official video was even shot for the NBA Finals featuring Aguilera doing choreography with her dancers on a basketball court. Also, in 2007, American Idol winner Jordin Sparks sang this song at the finale.\n \n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Fighter&quot; is the third single written by Christina Aguilera and Scott Storch for Aguilera's second album Stripped.
