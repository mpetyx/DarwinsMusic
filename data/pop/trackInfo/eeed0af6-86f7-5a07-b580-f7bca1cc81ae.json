It was written and composed by band member Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, Anthony Dent, and Mathew Knowles for the band's third studio album Survivor (2001). In 2002, the song also won the trio a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.\n \n The video won the 2001 MTV Video Music Award for Best R&amp;B Video, and a Soul Train Lady of Soul Award for Best R&amp;B/Soul Single, Group, Band or Duo. The opening track of singer-songwriter Jill Sobule's 2004 album The Folk Years 2003-2003 is a cover of the song, and a pseudo-cover of the song also opens rapper Vanilla Ice's 2005 album Platinum Underground.\n \n Lead singer Beyonc\u00e9 was inspired to write the lyrics for &quot;Survivor&quot; after hearing a radio DJ tease about the fact that three members had already left Destiny's Child, much like getting voted off the Survivor reality show TV series &amp; the song was eventually used in the May 1, 2001 Survivor (reality show) season finale commercial, and on a VH1 interview on April 8, 2006. Beyonc\u00e9 later confirmed in an interview that the show also did indeed inspire the song. The video is styled in the sense of three survivors living on an uninhabited island. It also shows a brief prelude to how the girls got shipwrecked. The song has proved to be the signature song of Destiny's Child for its powerful message, along with &quot;Say My Name&quot;, &quot;Jumpin', Jumpin'&quot;, &quot;Bootylicious&quot; and &quot;Independent Women (Part I)&quot;.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Survivor&quot; is a song by American R&amp;B group Destiny's Child.
