The song also won Best British Single at the 1990 Brit Awards.\n \n Collins's version was listed at #86 on Billboard's Greatest Songs of all time.\n \n The song was another huge hit for Collins. On December 23, 1989, it became Collins's seventh (and to date, final) number-one single in the United States. The song was also the final number-one song of the 1980s in the U.S., and remained at number-one for four weeks, which sometimes classifies the song as a hit from the 1990s as well. It also saw out the 1980s and saw in the 1990s at the top of the German singles chart. The song had already reached number two in the UK in November of that year. The single version is slightly different from the album version in that it uses a shorter intro. David Crosby also appears on the backing vocals.
