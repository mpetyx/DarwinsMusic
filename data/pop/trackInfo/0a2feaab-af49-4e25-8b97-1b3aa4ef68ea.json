Although my first love broke off our relationship, no longer wanting to marry me, I remained in love. When I married, and the magic never happened, I thought about her often and knew I was still in love...a couple decades passed before I accepted that there was no hope for a relationship. I'm sure songs like this still bring up such thoughts of once-upon-a-times and never-weres, but I can't not listen to a lovely song. If it makes me sad, another song can bring me back to an even plane. The one that has brightened my mood lately is \"I make my own Sunshine\", a sweet little tune by Alyssa Bonagura. I adopted it as an anthem. She, like Dido, has a beautiful voice. Some of the songs on her CD also bring an emotional response, but I'm drawn to the beauty of great lyrics and a lovely voice. Take heart, xCUDDLECOREx. You will never forget, but you can find new love. And enjoy Dido. She's wonderful.", "So this is basically how I feel about my ex.
