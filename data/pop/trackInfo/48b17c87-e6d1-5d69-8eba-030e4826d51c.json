It was released on June 14, 2007 by Jive Records as the fifth single from the album. The song was co-written and produced by Timberlake, Timbaland, and Nate &quot;Danja&quot; Hills.\n \n In contrast to the album's theme about sexual innuendos with themes of love, &quot;LoveStoned&quot; contains sexually suggestive lyrics. Musically &quot;LoveStoned&quot; is an upbeat dance song, contrasting with the interlude of &quot;I Think She Knows&quot; which has a more slower, quiet, guitar-driven sound.[1] The song includes a string section. &quot;LoveStoned/I Think She Knows&quot; was well-received by music critics, who noted the track's general sound and lyrics.\n \n The track entered the top ten on most charts, topping several of Billboard magazine's component charts, including the number one spot on the Hot Dance Club Play and Hot Dance Airplay charts, respectively. The international chart performance of the single failed to match its domestic success, never reaching the top spot. Following the release, &quot;LoveStoned/I Think She Knows&quot; was downloaded 39,000 times on iTunes. The song won Best Dance Recording at the 2008 Grammy Awards. The single has been widely sampled, with different covers and sounds.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "LoveStonedOneRiotYahooAmazonTwitterdel.icio.us\n From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n Jump to: navigation, search\n &quot;LoveStoned&quot;\n Single by Justin Timberlake\n from the album FutureSex/LoveSounds\n Released \tJune 14, 2007 (2007-06-14)\n (See release history)\n Format \tCD, digital download\n Genre \tDance pop\n Length \t7:24 (album version)\n 5:29 (radio edit)\n Label \tJive\n Writer(s) \tJustin Timberlake, Timbaland, Danja\n Producer \tTimbaland, Justin Timberlake, Nate (Danja) Hills\n ", "published": "Wed, 17 Mar 2010 03:35:11 +0000"}, "streamable": {"#text": "0", "fulltrack": "0"}, "name": "LoveStoned/I Think She Knows Interlude", "artist": {"url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Justin+Timberlake", "mbid": "11ed83a4-0097-4322-aa1e-8fea09def405", "name": "Justin Timberlake"}, "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Justin+Timberlake/_/LoveStoned%2FI+Think+She+Knows+Interlude", "listeners": "145744", "toptags": {"tag": [{"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/pop", "name": "pop"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/dance", "name": "dance"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/rnb", "name": "rnb"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/justin%20timberlake", "name": "justin timberlake"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/hip-hop", "name": "hip-hop"}]}, "mbid": "", "duration": "444000", "playcount": "710664", "id": "65987028"}}
