As opposed to all the sad and depressing things I write about, I decided to write something about the joining together of people in some kind of euphoric state - be it at a festival, at a show or in a club. I wanted a song that would reach out to people of every background and every enjoyment, whether you enjoy a natural high, taking drugs, drinking or whatever. Because I'm essentially a pop artist I wanted to write a song that everyone can relate to.&quot;\n \n About the inspiration for the video, Goulding said: &quot;I wanted it to be quite simple and down-to-earth to keep focus on the song. I guess it's just me kind of feeling the vibes. I wanted to be able to have freedom, which I literally do when I float in the air.&quot;\n \n Twenty three year old <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ellie+Goulding\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Ellie Goulding</a> was awarded the Critics Choice Award at this years Brits, an accolade held by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Florence+%252B+the+Machine\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Florence + the Machine</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Adele\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Adele</a> in previous years so a great omen of things to come!
