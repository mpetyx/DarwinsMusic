The song was released on July 20, 1998 in the United Kingdom and gained positive reviews from critics. The song also charted fairly well becoming the band\u2019s eighth number one single gaining a Platinum certification whilst also topping the charts in New Zealand. The single was a commercial success though the promotion was poor due to the departure of Halliwell.\n An accompanying music video directed by Steve Box was released featuring the five band members as animated fairies that interact with two friends in a forest. The four remaining members performed the track on shows Top of the Pops and on the National Lottery television show. An adapted duet version was performed with Pavarotti at his annual charity event Pavarotti and Friends. The song was also performed live as a five-piece on their return concert tour, Return of the Spice Girls.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Viva Forever&quot; is a song by the Spice Girls from their second album, Spiceworld.
