The song was Perry's first major label release, and was later placed on her major label album, One of the Boys. The song was released digitally as well as a 12&quot; EP. Capitol Records offered this song as a free download on her website. The song failed to enter the Billboard Hot 100.\n \n When asked about her debut single, Perry said the song was a &quot;soft hello&quot;. The song &quot;wasn't meant to be a big single or show what the album is going to be all about. That was for my Internet bloggers, so I'm not coming out of nowhere.&quot; Perry's A&amp;R Chris Anokute confirmed this by saying that they had no plans for radio coverage but just wanted to put this &quot;novelty&quot; song out online as an introduction to see &quot;what the attraction was&quot;. As expected sales were low, but Anokute said the EP did well in terms of building a press story.\n \n For the release of the single, Perry's label told her to include a cover. She originally wanted to cover a Queen song, but couldn't think of a particularly club-worthy song. While at a club with her friends, The Outfield's &quot;Your Love&quot; was played. Perry said that when the song came on, every girl in the place went onto the dance floor, and she wanted to have that same effect.\n \n Promotion and reception\n A female blond performer onstage wearing a white tuxedo and singing to a microphone in her left hand. A similarly dressed woman claps on her left. They are encircled by a group of guys in roller skates.

The song itself has been described as an &quot;emo-bashing anthem that's either horribly homophobic, a sly piece of social commentary or, possibly, both&quot;. The St. Petersburg Times writes that the &quot;boyfriend-skewering...isn't homophobic, but it does pummel straight guys who can't handle her edge&quot;.\n \n Some critics, however, conclude the song is homophobic. Ugo.com says the song settles for &quot;catchphrase-homophobia&quot; while Allmusic describes the lyrics as &quot;gay-baiting&quot;\n \n \n Released -November 20, 2007 (2007-11-20)\n Format-Digital download\n Recorded-2007\n Genre-Pop rock\n Length-3:39\n Label-Capitol\n Writer-Katy Perry, Greg Wells\n Producer-Greg Wells\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Ur So Gay&quot; is the debut promotional single released by pop singer Katy Perry, produced by Greg Wells and engineered by Drew Pearson.
