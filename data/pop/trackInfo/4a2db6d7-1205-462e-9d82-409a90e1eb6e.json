According to Music Rooms, Perry claims that after a wild night of partying and streaking, she wrote the song about her antics the next day. Perry revealed: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than an impromptu dance party with my friends. My track Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.) is a song about debauchery because I had one of those nights in Santa Barbara. We went out to this place called Wildcat and got crazy,\u201d Perry admitted: \u201cWe had a couple of beers and danced until we died, then brought the party back to the hotel room.\u201d She added: \u201cMost of that song is actual truth, apart from the m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois\u2026 unfortunately! But, yes, streaking in the park, that\u2019s what we did, so we had to write a song about it the next day!\u201d Bonnie McKee, the co-writer of the song stated &quot;TGIF is pretty much a word for word description of our trip to Santa Barbara [with Perry], so I love that one. It\u2019s really kitschy and fun and makes me nostalgic.&quot;\n \n \n \n Released: June 6, 2011 (2011-06-06)\n Recorded: \tConway Recording Studios,\n (Hollywood, California);\n Playback Recording Studios,\n (Santa Barbara, California)\n Genre: \tPop Rock\n Length:\t3:50\n Label:\tCapitol\n Writer(s): \tKaty Perry, Lukasz Gottwald, Max Martin, Bonnie McKee\n Producer: \tDr. Luke, Max Martin\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)&quot; is a song by American recording artist Katy Perry.
