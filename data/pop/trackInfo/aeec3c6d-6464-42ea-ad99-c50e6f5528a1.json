Written by Nate &quot;Danja&quot; Hills, Marcella &quot;Ms. Lago&quot; Araica, <a href=\"http://last.fm/music/Keri+Hilson\" rel=\"nofollow\">Keri Hilson</a> and James Washington, it was produced by Danja for Spears' fifth studio album, <a href=\"http://last.fm/music/Britney+Spears/Blackout\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blackout</a>. The track was released as the third and final single from the album in the first quarter of 2008. \n \n Some critics have suggested that this would have been a more suitable album lead-off track than &quot;Gimme More ,&quot; since in this song, Spears re-introduces herself at the top and apologizes for being gone for so long.  This track has a second meaning where Spears is apologizing for being away so long from her love interest. The song's co-writer Keri Hilson told MTV Canada News: &quot;It's about two people, a girl and a guy, and the girl is saying, 'You're a little cold. Let me warm things up and break the ice.' &quot; She added that she was amazed at Spears' work ethic: &quot;When we were arranging the vocals in the studio at her house, she was about eight months pregnant, and she was standing up in the vocal booth, just banging it out. Three weeks later, she had the baby.&quot;\n \n The music video, Spears' first animated one, features the singer as an animated superhero in a futuristic world. It was made in South Korea in Japanese anime style. The song has topped several Dance Club Play charts, including Billboard in the United States and in Australia.\n \n 'Break The Ice' was the third single release from Britney's fifth studio album '<a title=\"Britney Spears - Blackout\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Britney+Spears/Blackout\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Blackout</a>' and hit the UK charts in April 2008. It followed two monster singles '<a title=\"Britney Spears &ndash; Gimme More\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Britney+Spears/_/Gimme+More\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Gimme More</a>' &amp; '<a title=\"Britney Spears &ndash; Piece of Me\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Britney+Spears/_/Piece+of+Me\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Piece of Me</a>' and was her 21st UK hit single.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Break the Ice&quot; is a song by American pop singer Britney Spears.
