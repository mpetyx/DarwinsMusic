Miley wrote the song with Antonina Armato, Tim James, Devrim Karaoglu and Paul NZA.\n \n The music video was filmed on August 7, 2010 in Detroit, Michigan. It was directed by Robert Hales, who also helmed the clip for &quot;Can't Be Tamed.&quot; The racy clip shows Cyrus writhing semi-naked on a bed before getting dolled up in her room and grooving in the backseat of a car clad in tiny shorts. The singer came under fire from concerned parental groups - not the first time Cyrus has provoked a reaction as she attempts to break away from her clean image as a star. Tim Winter, president of the Parents Television Council, insisted to TMZ.com that the footage sends the wrong message to Cyrus' young fans. He said: &quot;It is unfortunate that she would participate in such a    ualized video like this one.\n It sends messages to her fan base that are diametrically opposed to everything she has done up to this point. Miley built her fame and fortune entirely on the backs of young     s, and it saddens us that she seems so eager to distance herself from that fan base so rapidly.&quot;\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Who Owns My Heart&quot; is the 2nd European single from Miley Cyrus' 3rd LP, Can't Be Tamed.
