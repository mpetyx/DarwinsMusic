The song is a reference to the classic Audrey Hepburn movie of the same name, and is sung from the perspective of a young man faced with a potential break-up with his girlfriend.

It was directed by Blake Edwards. The portrayal of Holly Golightly as the naive, eccentric socialite is generally considered to be Audrey Hepburn's most memorable and identifiable role. She herself regarded it as one of her most challenging roles to play, as she was an introvert who had to play an extrovert. Hepburn's singing of &quot;Moon River&quot; helped garner an Oscar for Best Song for composer Henry Mancini and lyricist Johnny Mercer. The film also featured what was arguably George Peppard's greatest acting role and the high point of his career. The film is loosely based on the novella of the same name by Truman Capote.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "The Song\n &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany's&quot; is a song by American rock band <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Deep+Blue+Something\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Deep Blue Something</a>, released in 1995 on their album <a title=\"Deep Blue Something - Home\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Deep+Blue+Something/Home\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Home</a>.
