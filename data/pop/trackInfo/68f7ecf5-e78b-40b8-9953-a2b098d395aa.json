Written and produced by Motown's main production team, Holland-Dozier-Holland, &quot;You Can't Hurry Love&quot; is one of the signature Supremes songs, and also one of Motown's signature releases. The single was the number-one song on the Billboard Pop Singles singles chart for two weeks, from September 4, 1966 to September 17, 1966, and reached number one on the soul chart for two weeks. The song became a number-one hit again sixteen years later, when Phil Collins' 1982 cover reached number-one on the UK Singles Chart for two weeks beginning on January 9, 1983.\n \n Unlike many of the earlier Supremes records, &quot;You Can't Hurry Love&quot; has inspired significant cover versions. The most notable of these was released in late 1982 as a single by Phil Collins from his second solo album, Hello, I Must Be Going!. Collins' version reached number-one on the UK Singles Chart (becoming his first number-one solo hit in the UK and peaking two positions higher than the original song did in that country), and reached number 10 in the United States. Although Collins had previously done covers before on album (of &quot;Behind The Lines&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;), &quot;You Can't Hurry Love&quot; was the first cover he released as a single. Collins' version was the first track on the very first Now That's What I Call Music CD.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "You Can't Hurry Love is a number-one single recorded by The Supremes for the Motown label, released during the summer of 1966.
