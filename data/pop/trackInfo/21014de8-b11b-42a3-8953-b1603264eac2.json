The video was also featured in Moonwalker. In essence, the video is an amusement park consisting of stylistically crude images based around Jackson's successful career since <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/1982\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">1982</a>'s <a title=\"Michael Jackson - Thriller\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson/Thriller\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Thriller</a>. Consistent with the song's lyrical content, there is an emphasis on the tabloid view of Jackson's personal life and public image, referring to the nickname &quot;Wacko Jacko&quot; given to him by the press, and the various headlines associated with him in the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/1980s\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">1980s</a>. Lampooning rumours that he tried to purchase the &quot;Elephant Man's&quot; bones, Jackson dances with stop motion &quot;Elephant Man&quot; bones in the video. This particular segment (without the image of the bones) was used for the single's cover art. At the end of the video, it is revealed that a gigantic Jackson himself is the amusement park. He breaks free, tearing the park to pieces.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "<a title=\"Michael Jackson &ndash; Leave Me Alone\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson/_/Leave+Me+Alone\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Leave Me Alone</a> was the eighth single to be released from <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Michael Jackson</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/1987\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">1987</a> album <a title=\"Michael Jackson - Bad\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson/Bad\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Bad</a>.
