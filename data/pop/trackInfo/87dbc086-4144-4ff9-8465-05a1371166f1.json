Frontman Michael Angelakos described the song as &quot;[his] favourite song on the record&quot;. On 19th November 2012, Passion Pit announced a &quot;Carried Away Remix Contest&quot; in collaboration with Indaba Music. The winner, Freddie Westborn, won $1000 as his prize and his remix was released as a free download.\n \n \n Music Video\n \n The music video for &quot;Carried Away&quot; was directed by Ben and Alex Brewer, produced by Braxton Pope and Saul Levitz - in collaboration with Sophia Bush. The video shows a relationship between Michael Angelakos and Sophia Bush who seem to quarrel and argue quite a lot, however as the end draws near and the relationship becomes weaker and weaker, we see the two reconcile their differences and taking back the things that they have said to each other. The video was released on February 14th (appropriately Valentine's Day) and has reached over 3,000,000 views on the Passion Pit Vevo YouTube account as of June 2013.\n \n \n \n Released\tJanuary 8, 2013\n Format\tDigital download\n Recorded\t2011; Gigantic Studios\n Genre\tIndie pop, synthpop\n Length\t3:42\n Label\t        Columbia\n Writer(s)\tMichael Angelakos\n Producer\tMichael Angelakos, Chris Zane\n \n \n \n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Carried Away&quot; is a song by American alternative rock band Passion Pit from their second studio album, Gossamer (2012).
