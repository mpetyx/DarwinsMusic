The music video features children living in countries suffering from unrest. It is also one of only a handful of Michael Jackson's videos not to feature Jackson himself, the others being &quot;Cry&quot;, &quot;HIStory&quot; and &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot;. (The clips for &quot;HIStory&quot; and &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot; only feature Michael Jackson in archival footage). Jackson performed the song in the Super Bowl XXVII halftime show with a 35000 person flash card performance.\n \n In a 2001 Internet chat with fans, Jackson said &quot;Heal the World&quot; is the song he is most proud to have created. He also created the Heal the World Foundation, a charitable organization which was designed to improve the lives of children. The organization was also meant to teach children how to help others. This concept of 'betterment for all' would become a centerpiece for the Dangerous World Tour. In the documentary Living with Michael Jackson, Jackson said he created the song in his &quot;Giving Tree&quot; at the Neverland Ranch.\n \n The song reached #2 in the UK Singles Chart in December 1992, kept off the #1 position by Whitney Houston's &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;. It fared less well in the US, reaching a peak of #27 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming his second consecutive single not to reach the Top 20.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Heal the World is a song from Michael Jackson's hit album, Dangerous, released in 1991.
