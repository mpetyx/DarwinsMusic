The song was originally released on strictly limited edition 7&quot; vinyl (500 copies) in the UK on 24 April 2006, accompanied by album track, &quot;<a title=\"Lily Allen &ndash; Knock 'Em Out\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Lily+Allen/_/Knock+%27Em+Out\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Knock 'Em Out</a>&quot;, and was re-released in September following the huge success of Allen's second single &quot;<a title=\"Lily Allen &ndash; Smile\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Lily+Allen/_/Smile\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Smile</a>&quot;. The re-release peaked at number six on the UK singles chart. The song is used in the soundtrack of the film The Nanny Diaries, and in the trailer for Happy-Go-Lucky. This song was #30 on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007. In 2008 the song was included in the soundtrack of the Mike Leigh film Happy-Go-Lucky. Allen claims that the inspiration for the song was William Wordsworth's poem &quot;Composed upon Westminster Bridge, September 3, 1802&quot;.\n \n &quot;LDN&quot; is Mobile Phone text language for London. The lyrics are of Lily describing a bicycle ride through her hometown of London. Set to a cheerful tune, the lyrics first appear to describe a lovely scene &quot;A fella looking dapper, and he's sittin' with a slapper&quot;, but follow up revealing a less glamorous reality, &quot;Then I see it's a pimp and his crack whore.&quot;\n \n Several episodes from &quot;city life&quot; are described, suggesting that things may not be what they seem: &quot;When you look with your eyes everything seems nice, But if you look twice you can see it's all lies.&quot; However, Lily finds these sights &quot;priceless&quot;, and asks (possibly sarcastically), &quot;Oh why, oh why, would I wanna be anywhere else?&quot;. The lyrics might take part of their inspiration from William Blake's poem &quot;London,&quot; which paints the city in a similar light.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;LDN&quot; (Internet slang for &quot;London&quot;) is a single by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Lily+Allen\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Lily Allen</a> which was released in the UK on 25 September 2006.
