It was written by Max Martin, Kristian Lundin and Brian Littrell and is mainly a tribute to the group's fans. The song broke the record for longest running #1 on MTV's Total Request Live. Longtime friend, Brian McAndrew, was featured in the song with a guitar solo. The song reached #25 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #5 on the UK Singles Chart.\n \n The music video for &quot;Larger Than Life&quot; was a big-budget production directed by Joseph Kahn in August 1999, who also directed the band's &quot;Everybody (Backstreet's Back)&quot; video in June 1997, which bears a number of similarities to this video. It takes place in a futuristic space setting, and includes elaborate special effects and animation, as well as a break-down with a dance number. The video opens with a long pass of a spaceship over the top of the camera as a number of the band's past singles cycle through as if on a radio dial. A robot, whose face is portrayed by Antonio Fargas, who played the driver in the &quot;Everybody&quot; video, awakens the band members from their sleep in pods on the ship.\n \n Each of the band members is subsequently featured in their own separate vignettes, while being featured together on a large stage doing a dance routine with backup dancers. A breakdown was added to the album version of the song before the final choruses for the extended dance sequence which continues to the end of the song. The vignettes are intercut with the dance sequence following the breakdown.\n \n The video reportedly went over budget, which was the reason that Howie Dorough's vignette was not particularly elaborate. The video holds a Guinness World Record for the 8th most expensive music video with estimated production costs of over US$2,100,000.\n \n Featured in the video game:\n     * Winning Eleven 10: Liga Djarum rising star\n \n \n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Released \tAugust 24, 1999  &quot;Larger Than Life&quot; is a song by the Backstreet Boys, released as the second single from their 1999 album, Millennium.
