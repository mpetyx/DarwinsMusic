Released in 2003, the single peaked at #33 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Aguilera's 11th Top 40 hit. The single also peaked at #9 in the UK and #19 in Australia. The single is most known for its simplistic, but critically acclaimed music video that was filmed in black and white as a single continuous camera shot. It is also noted for its resembelance to the My Immortal music video by rock group Evanescence which was released around the same time as this video. The video was nominated for three 2004 MTV Video Music Awards, Best Female Video, Viewer's Choice, and Best Cinematography.\n \n Song information\n \n &quot;The Voice Within&quot; was written by both Aguilera and Glen Ballard, and was produced by the latter. The album version extends the song about five seconds and blends it with the next track, &quot;I'm OK&quot;.\n \n An alternate edit clocking in at 4 minutes and 26 seconds appears on the compilation album Totally Hits 2004.\n \n Aguilera did not want &quot;The Voice Within&quot; to be released as the fifth single. She was lobbying for &quot;Impossible&quot;, a track from Stripped, which was produced by Alicia Keys, as she felt it would help her break into the urban market. RCA Records wanted to release a big ballad during the holiday season like they did the year prior with &quot;Beautiful&quot; and felt that 'The Voice Within' was the perfect candidate. Eventually, Aguilera's label made the final decision and the idea of 'Impossible' being the final single was scrapped.\n \n It was performed on the third season of Australian Idol during &quot;Contestant's Choice&quot; week (Top 9) by Roxane LeBrasse. Despite receiving good reviews from the judges, LeBrasse was eliminated the next night.\n \n The song was performed later by American Idol 5 runner-up Katharine McPhee during 'Songs from the 21st Century' week (Top 10). During this performance, judge Simon Cowell compared McPhee's abilities to that of Aguilera's, saying the former's performance was almost as good as the original singer. He then said it was mediocre during the result show the night after, where McPhee landed in the bottom two.\n \n The song was later performed in the film The Voice Within by Regina Fuller and the title was borrowed for the film.\n \n Music video\n \n The song's music video was directed by David LaChapelle. It opens with a close-up of Aguilera and zooms out to her wearing a slip and sitting in an abandoned prop room. In one continuous black-and-white shot, Aguilera walks through several rooms, exits the building, and finally lays on a light box. The video was filmed at a deserted theater in downtown Los Angeles, California. It is inspired by neorealist works.[1]\n \n &quot;The Voice Within'&quot; was the eleventh video for Aguilera to appear on TRL. The video hit number one twice and spent thirty-seven days on the countdown.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;The Voice Within&quot; is the fifth and final single from Christina Aguilera's second album, Stripped.
