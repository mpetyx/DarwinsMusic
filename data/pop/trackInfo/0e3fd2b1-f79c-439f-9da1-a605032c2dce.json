She insists on continuing the pursuit of this character until he does love her. \n \n According to the <a href=\"http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=12723\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paparazzi Songfacts</a>, Lady GaGa told About.com: &quot;The song is about a few different things \u2013 it's about my struggles, do I want fame or do I want love? It's also about wooing the paparazzi to fall in love with me. It's about the media whoring, if you will, watching ersatzes make fools of themselves to their station. It's a love song for the cameras, but it's also a love song about fame or love \u2013 can you have both, or can you only have one?&quot; \n \n Lady GaGa has performed many different versions of Paparazzi. The most eye catching was her VMA 2009 performance, where she bled and later hung from the ceiling. In an interview, GaGa said her performance was about Princess Diana and how the paparazzi killed her.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "This song is the sixth single released from her debut album, The Fame.
