{"track": {"wiki": {"content": "&quot;Telephone&quot; is a song by American recording artist Lady Gaga from her second studio album The Fame Monster, featuring American R&amp;B singer Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles. Gaga originally wrote &quot;Telephone&quot; for Britney Spears; however, plans did not go through, and Gaga recorded the song herself, with Beyonc\u00e9 as the featured vocalist. The main inspiration behind the song was Gaga's fear of suffocation. The lyrics portray the singer as preferring the dance floor, rather than answer her lover's phone calls. Gaga explained that the telephone addressed in the lyrics of the song, is in reality a person telling her to continue working harder. Musically, the song consists of an expanded bridge, verse-rap and an epilogue  where the line is disconnected. Knowles appears in the middle of the song, singing the verses in a rapid-fire way, accompanied by double beats.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Telephone&quot; is a song by American recording artist Lady Gaga from her second studio album The Fame Monster, featuring American R&amp;B singer Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles.
