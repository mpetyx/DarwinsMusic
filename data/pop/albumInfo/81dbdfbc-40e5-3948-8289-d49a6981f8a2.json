{"album": {"wiki": {"content": "Tangled Up is the fourth studio album of British girl group Girls Aloud, released on 16 November 2007, through Fascination Records. The album was produced by Brian Higgins and production team Xenomania, and recorded over six months. According to the group, the production and songwriting began with each member meeting with Higgins to discuss what had happened with them since the release of Chemistry (2005). Tangled Up was mostly praised by contemporary music critics upon its release, and achieved moderate success, debuting at number four on the UK Albums Chart, while missing the top twenty on the Irish Albums Chart. However, the album was certified Gold in Ireland and Platinum in UK.\n \n The album spawned three top ten singles: &quot;Sexy! No No No...&quot; was co-wrote by Girls Aloud and released as the first single. The second single was &quot;Call the Shots&quot;, which performed better than the first, and was deemed as the favorite track on Tangled Up from bandmate Cheryl Cole. The final single, &quot;Can't Speak French&quot;, almost missed the top ten, peaking at number nine. To further promote the album, Girls Aloud embarked on a tour of the same name in 2008.\n \n Tangled Up features a dancier, more electronic approach to pop music, in comparison to Girls Aloud's previous albums. The &quot;new&quot; sound was inspired by the success of their 2006 single &quot;Something Kinda Ooooh&quot;. Once again, Brian Higgins brought diversity to the record. Drawing inspiration from drum n bass, europop, disco-pop, electronic rock, synthpop and no-electro genres like jazz, psychedelic-ish music, ska and power pop.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Tangled Up is the fourth studio album of British girl group Girls Aloud, released on 16 November 2007, through Fascination Records.
