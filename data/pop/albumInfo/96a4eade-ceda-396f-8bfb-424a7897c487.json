{"album": {"wiki": {"content": "Discography: The Complete Singles Collection is an 18 track compilation by the UK electronic music group Pet Shop Boys. It was first released in 1991. The album charted at No 3 in the UK album charts.\n \n As the name suggests, Discography is a collection of all of the hit singles by Pet Shop Boys up to that point (1991), alongside two new tracks &quot;DJ Culture&quot; and &quot;Was It Worth It?&quot;. Although all other songs on this album had appeared in some form on their previous albums, only six of the songs previously appeared on an album in their single versions.\n \n The album contains the Pet Shop Boys cover version of U2's hit &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot;, which later in the song breaks into the chorus of The Four Seasons' &quot;Can't Take My Eyes Off You&quot;.\n \n Around the time of the release of Discography, Pet Shop Boys also released a video collection, Videography, consisting of the music videos for each of the songs on this album in a slightly different order and with the song &quot;Was It Worth It?&quot; being replaced with &quot;How Can You Expect to Be Taken Seriously?&quot;, which itself was not on the audio versions of the album, despite being part of a double a-side with &quot;Where the streets have no name (I Can't Take My Eyes Off You)&quot; (the exclusion due to the constrictions of the CD's running time).\n \n In 2003, Pet Shop Boys released an updated single collection called PopArt, which featured the video version of &quot;Suburbia&quot; and the album mix of &quot;Heart&quot; by mistake but excluding &quot;Was It Worth It?&quot;. In addition, it featured all the Pet Shop Boys singles released after 1991 with the exception of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; and &quot;How Can You Expect to Be Taken Seriously?&quot;.\n \n Track listing\n # Title Writer(s) Length \n 1. &quot;West End Girls&quot; (from Please, 1986) Chris Lowe, Neil Tennant 3:59 \n 2. &quot;Love Comes Quickly&quot; (from Please, 1986) Stephen Hague, Lowe, Tennant 4:17 \n 3. &quot;Opportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money)&quot; (from Please, 1986) Lowe, Tennant 3:36 \n 4. &quot;Suburbia&quot; (from Please, 1986) Lowe, Tennant 4:03 \n 5. &quot;It's a Sin&quot; (from Actually, 1987) Lowe, Tennant 4:59 \n 6. &quot;What Have I Done to Deserve This?&quot; (from Actually, 1987) Lowe, Tennant, Willis 4:19 \n 7. &quot;Rent&quot; (from Actually, 1987) Lowe, Tennant 3:32 \n 8. &quot;Always on My Mind&quot; (from Introspective, 1988) Christopher, James, Thompson 3:53 \n 9. &quot;Heart&quot; (from Actually, 1987) Lowe, Tennant 4:16 \n 10. &quot;Domino Dancing&quot; (from Introspective, 1988) Lowe, Tennant 4:17 \n 11. &quot;Left to My Own Devices&quot; (from Introspective, 1988) Lowe, Tennant 4:46 \n 12. &quot;It's Alright&quot; (from Introspective, 1988) Sterling Void 4:19 \n 13. &quot;So Hard&quot; (from Behaviour, 1990) Lowe, Tennant 3:58 \n 14. &quot;Being Boring&quot; (from Behaviour, 1990) Lowe, Tennant 4:50 \n 15. &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name (I Can't Take My Eyes Off You)&quot;   Clayton, Crewe, Evans, Hewson, ... 4:30 \n 16. &quot;Jealousy&quot; (from Behaviour, 1990) Lowe, Tennant 4:15 \n 17. &quot;DJ Culture&quot; (Debut) Lowe, Tennant 4:13 \n 18. &quot;Was It Worth It?&quot; (Debut) Lowe, Tennant 4:22 \n \n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Discography: The Complete Singles Collection is an 18 track compilation by the UK electronic music group Pet Shop Boys.
