{"album": {"wiki": {"content": "<em>The Time of Our Lives</em> is an EP released by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Miley+Cyrus\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Miley Cyrus</a>. It was released exclusively to Wal-Mart on August 28, 2009 with her clothing line with Max Azria. It was originally planned to be released on August 31, 2009, but due to confusion at Wal-Mart stores carrying the CD as well as her recently-launched fashion range, the album and clothing line were released together - three days earlier than was intended. The EP features the smash hit &quot;<a title=\"Miley Cyrus &ndash; Party in the U.S.A.\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Miley+Cyrus/_/Party+in+the+U.S.A.\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Party in the U.S.A.</a>,&quot; which peaked at number two on the <em>Billboard</em> Hot 100, and the second single, &quot;<a title=\"Miley Cyrus &ndash; When I Look at You\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Miley+Cyrus/_/When+I+Look+at+You\" class=\"bbcode_track\">When I Look at You</a>,&quot; which peaked at number 16 on the <em>Billboard</em> Hot 100 singles. The track is from the film, <em>The Last Song</em>, which Miley stared in. The album debuted on the <em>Billboard</em> 200 albums at number two 63,729 copies sold. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Colbie+Caillat\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Colbie Caillat</a> kept her from debuting at number one with only three days of sales. The next week, it stayed at number two with 161,604 copies sold. It would've been higher if it not had been released earlier. Instead, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Whitney+Houston\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Whitney Houston</a> debuted at number one with sales almost twice as much as Cyrus.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "The Time of Our Lives is an EP released by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Miley+Cyrus\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Miley Cyrus</a>.
