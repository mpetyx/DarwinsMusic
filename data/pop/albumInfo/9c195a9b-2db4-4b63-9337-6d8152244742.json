{"album": {"wiki": {"content": "Unbroken is the third studio album by American singer\u2013songwriter Demi Lovato. The album was released on September 20, 2011 by Hollywood Records. The lead single, &quot;Skyscraper&quot; was released on July 12, 2011.\n After the release and disclosure of her second album, Here We Go Again, in the second half of 2009, Lovato was dedicated to her acting career, with recordings for the series and movies Sonny with a Chance and Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam and their soundtracks. Therefore, recording the first track on this album was made only in July 2010 with producer Dapo Torimiro.\n That same month, the singer gave an interview to MTV, in which she said she was &quot;creating a new sound,&quot; it would be &quot;fun. A little more R&amp;B/pop.&quot; Later, in conversation with AHN, quoted Rihanna and Keri Hilson as influences. At the time, she revealed she planned to work in no hurry on this album, stating that &quot;Every other album I haven\u2019t had time to really take my time and craft it like I really wanted to do because I was finding spare time between a television show, and movies, and touring, and then all over again. I\u2019ve worked on (the album) for the past year and really gone hard over the past few months, but you can definitely tell that I took my time with this record.&quot;\n In August 2010, Demi entered in the Camp Rock World Tour 2010 to release the movie Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam. In November, she left the tour due to personal problems and was admitted to a clinic for three months. During this time, the recordings were interrupted. Some time after leaving the clinic, the singer returned to work on the album, in April 2011, it was reported that she was also working with producers/songwriters Sandy Vee and August Rigo. Later that month, was announced that she would leave Sonny with a Chance, in which she portrayed Sonny Munroe, the main character. She left the show because she wanted to focus on her music career more than acting.\n \n Lovato said in her column in Seventeen Magazine, in early June 2011:\n I love being back in the studio! It's been very therapeutic to be able to express my feelings and talk about who I really am, through my music. It also helps that I've been lucky enough to work with such talented people on the record so far! With my new album, I'm hoping to provide inspiration for girls everywhere who are going through the same issues I've faced. I think this will come through in a lot of the material. My first single is really special to me\u2014 to me it symbolizes my journey from the person I was to the happy healthy person I am today, and the fact that people are able to rise above anything, despite the odds. I'm so excited to share all of this with you guys! The experience has been amazing so far and I'm really enjoying the whole process. There are definitely a lot of emotions that go into making an album. I feel blessed, inspired, and nervous with anticipation, but mostly, I feel excited about the future, and about sharing this new record with my fans!\n In July 2011, Demi described the album as &quot;more mature&quot; than their previous sound and more fun and light than her first single, &quot;Skyscraper&quot;, while other tracks are more intense. On August 11th, 2011, Demi used her Twitter account and Facebook page to announce the title of her album (Unbroken).\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Unbroken is the third studio album by American singer\u2013songwriter Demi Lovato.
