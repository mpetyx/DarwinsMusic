{"album": {"wiki": {"content": "Life in Cartoon Motion is the debut album by pop singer Mika, produced by Greg Wells and Mika, mixed by Greg Wells, with co-production on two songs by Jodi Marr and John Merchant, released on Island Records on February 5, 2007 in the UK, and on Universal/Motown Records on March 27, 2007 in the U.S..\n \n The single &quot;Grace Kelly&quot; stayed at #1 in the UK for five weeks straight and became a #1 hit in many countries. The album debuted at #1 in the UK, selling 5.6 million copies worldwide since its release and counting. The album cover of Life in Cartoon Motion has since been used in an iPod Touch commercial. It was the fifth best-selling album in the world in 2007.\n \n Review by Allmusic:\n Mika's vivid, aptly named debut album, Life in Cartoon Motion, borrows and builds on the glittery, glamorous, and not-so-secretly sentimental musical territory carved out by Elton John and Freddie Mercury, or more recently, Rufus Wainwright and the Scissor Sisters. Fortunately, his name-dropping, shape-shifting pop is usually good, and genuine, enough to come across as eloquent homage rather than blatant thievery or a tired rehash. Mika's singles are his most charming moments, especially the instant sunshine of &quot;Grace Kelly,&quot; which crams tap-dancing rhythms, filmic dialogue, Elton's pianos, Freddie's vocal harmonies, and Brian May's guitars into just over three minutes. &quot;Relax (Take It Easy)&quot; is in the same vein of hypnotic, danceable melancholy as the Scissor Sisters' reworking of &quot;Comfortably Numb,&quot; albeit less showy, while &quot;Billy Brown&quot;'s brass arrangement, flowing melody, and soft-shoe rhythms give it the feel of an unusually witty show tune about pre-life crises and living in the closet. As Life in Cartoon Motion unfolds, it reveals more of Mika's musical identity, both for better and worse. His classical piano training gives the album an appealing fluidity, especially on &quot;Any Other World,&quot; and lilting, Afro-pop-inspired guitars and harmonies pop up here and there, most effectively on &quot;Big Girl (You Are Beautiful).&quot; However, while Life in Cartoon Motion has lots of enthusiasm and creativity, it doesn't have a lot of nuance. On songs like &quot;Lollipop&quot; and &quot;Love Today,&quot; Mika straddles the line between adorable and annoying. And as the overly long, overwrought &quot;Erase&quot; shows, he also doesn't have quite the masterful touch with gentler songs that his influences possess. As admirable as Life in Cartoon Motion's eclecticism is, it could use more focus \u2014 something that songs like the jaunty breakup song &quot;Stuck in the Middle&quot; and angry rocker &quot;Ring Ring&quot; suggest Mika is developing. While more restraint could've taken the album from good to great, its Technicolor, everything-at-once, borderline overdone feel makes it a fitting portrait of Mika as a young artist.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Life in Cartoon Motion is the debut album by pop singer Mika, produced by Greg Wells and Mika, mixed by Greg Wells, with co-production on two songs by Jodi Marr and John Merchant, released on Island Records on February 5, 2007 in the UK, and on Universal/Motown Records on March 27, 2007 in the U.S..
