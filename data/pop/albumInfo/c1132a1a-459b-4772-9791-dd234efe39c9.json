According to Lovato, the album will &quot;provide inspiration for girls everywhere who are going through the same issues I've faced&quot;. Lovato also said a sequel to the song &quot;Skyscraper&quot; is also included. &quot;I'm incredibly proud of this album,&quot; she said in a statement. &quot;It's better than anything I have ever done! I experimented with a variety of different sounds and poured my heart into writing these songs. I'm so excited for everyone to finally get the chance to hear them!&quot;\n \n On May 6, 2013, Lovato asked her Twitter followers to &quot;unlock&quot; the entire album by putting song titles in hashtags. A special website lovaticsspeeduptime.com was launched, displaying all the songs next to a clock that would turn as tweets would be sent. Once a song became a trending topic, its YouTube video was made available on VEVO. All the songs were unlocked within a day.\n \n &quot;Heart Attack&quot; was released as the lead single for the album on February 24, 2013.
