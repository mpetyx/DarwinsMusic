{"album": {"wiki": {"content": "For Your Entertainment is the debut album from American artist and American Idol season eight runner-up, Adam Lambert. It was released on November 23, 2009.\n \n Immediately following his participation on American Idol, Lambert began writing and recording with predominant pop hit makers such as Lady GaGa, Greg Wells, Max Martin, Linda Perry, RedOne, Ryan Tedder, Evan &quot;Kidd&quot; Bogart, Sam Sparro, Kara DioGuardi and P!nk.\n \n Lambert also announced through Twitter, that he had collaborated with American pop star, Lady Gaga. &quot;Yes it's true: I spent yesterday in the studio w/ the insanely talented and creative Lady Gaga recording a song that she wrote! I love her.&quot;\n \n On October 28, Lambert announced that the lead single would be &quot;For Your Entertainment&quot; produced by Dr. Luke. He tweeted. &quot;Debut single is called 'For Your Entertainment' get ready to shake yo asses to this song. It'll make ya dance for sure.&quot;  He also confirmed a song called &quot;Soaked&quot; written by Matthew Bellamy of Muse and a song called &quot;Music Again&quot; written by Justin Hawkins. Lambert also stated that he co-wrote four of the songs on the album, &quot;Strut&quot;, &quot;Pick U Up&quot;, &quot;Aftermath&quot; and &quot;Broken Open&quot;.\n \n Initial critical response to For Your Entertainment was generally favorable. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 67, based on seven reviews. The Huffington Post called the album &quot;An instant classic&quot; and also stated that &quot;As a whole, For Your Entertainment marks one of the most impressive mainstream pop album debuts in recent memory.&quot; The Detroit News said that &quot;It goes without saying that &quot;For Your Entertainment&quot; is the most poised debut from any &quot;Idol&quot; to date. Lambert has a vision and has successfully honed a sound that pays homage to his heroes while carving a niche for himself.&quot; Spin said the album is &quot;perhaps the strongest, most flavorful batch of tunes to reach an AI vet, and Lambert's polymorphous vocal skills unite dancefloor strut and hard-rock pomp in a convincing glam package.&quot; The Musictionary noted that &quot;the first solo LP simply has to define who the artist wants to be. With For Your Entertainment, Adam does that and more, presenting a truly unique conglomeration of rock, pop, dance and glam; even the track sequencing can\u2019t take away from that.&quot;\n \n Slant Magazine wrote that &quot;&quot;Music Again&quot; and the awkwardly written &quot;Strut&quot; every bit as obnoxious as the songs from Mika's The Boy Who Knew Too Much&quot; and that &quot;&quot;Music Again&quot; apes its production and a good deal of its melody from Mika's &quot;Touches You,&quot; while the title track and lead single is so similar to Sam Sparro's &quot;Black and Gold&quot; that 19 Entertainment should probably keep a strong legal team on retainer.&quot; Rolling Stone wrote that &quot;The songs sound great but feel strangely stuffy \u2014 Entertainment seems like a disc that was overthought. Next time, the hugely talented Lambert should make sure he's going straight for the gut.&quot;\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "For Your Entertainment is the debut album from American artist and American Idol season eight runner-up, Adam Lambert.
