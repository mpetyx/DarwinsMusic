{"album": {"wiki": {"content": "Escapology is a 2002 album by Robbie Williams, his fifth solo effort, and his last with producer and co-songwriter Guy Chambers. The most successful singles released from the album were &quot;Feel&quot; and &quot;Something Beautiful&quot;. Escapology was arguably conceived as a concept album due to its lyrics being totally reflective about Williams' life as a popstar in Los Angeles, particularly his hopes (&quot;Hot Fudge&quot;) and fears (&quot;Monsoon&quot;).\n \n Williams has said of the album that &quot;half of it is written from the standpoint of 'Look, this is really me with my tears of a clown. Do they love me or hate me?' The rest of it is about somebody that I have to think I am to get up onstage. Because little me wouldn't get up there. It's too scary!&quot;\n \n The album was revised for the U.S. market upon its release there in 2003 and was named the 'Best Album by a Solo Male' in the International Category on the Oye! Awards in Mexico.\n \n The album was certified as 7x Platinum in the UK.\n \n This album has been released with the Copy Control protection system in some regions.\n \n In 2002, Williams signed a record-breaking \u00a380 million contract with EMI.  The contract featured a number of provisos, including the label ceding greater creative control to the artist and a commitment to breaking Williams in the US market. In return, EMI affirmed they would benefit from a cut of Williams' non-recording activities, including touring, publishing, and merchandising, thus protecting the company from any commercial downturn in the singer's album sales. So far it has become the biggest music deal in British history.\n \n Williams began working on what would be his fifth studio album, after a year out recording, the album heralded a new era for Robbie; he had taken a more active role in the making of this album giving an indication of his growing confidence in the studio, and &quot;One Fine Day&quot;, &quot;Nan's Songs&quot; and &quot;Come Undone&quot; were the firsts songs that Robbie wrote without Guy Chambers input. Most of the songs were recorded in Los Angeles, with most vocals sung naked, one of the songs that didn't make the album was even recorded in a Superman costume.\n \n Initial critical response to Escapology was generally mixed. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average  score of 53, based on 11 reviews.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Escapology is a 2002 album by Robbie Williams, his fifth solo effort, and his last with producer and co-songwriter Guy Chambers.
