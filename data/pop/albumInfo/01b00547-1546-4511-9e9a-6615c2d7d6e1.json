The album includes a mixture of previously recorded material which leaked online in 2009 and 2010 during recording sessions, along with new songs with Tricky Stewart, The-Dream and RedOne commissioned by Island Records. The album combines R&amp;B, pop music and hip hop songs for a mixture of club-ready singles as well as slower mid-tempo songs. Lopez refers to Love? as containing her best vocals to date.\n \n Upon its release, Love? garnered mixed to positive reviews from music critics. While some were critical of it, others disagreed, praising it as a great dance album.
