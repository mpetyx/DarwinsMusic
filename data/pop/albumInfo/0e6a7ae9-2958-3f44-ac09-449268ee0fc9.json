The Album was certified 3-times Platinum in the U.K.. Heaven on Earth was also certified Platinum in many other countries among them the United States, Canada and Australia. The first single released &quot;Heaven Is a Place on Earth&quot; reached the number 1 position throughout the world making it a classical song. The second song released was &quot;I Get Weak&quot; written by the famous songwriter Diane Warren. &quot;I Get Weak&quot; reached the number #2 in the U.S. and the top 10 position in Canada and U.K.. The third single &quot;Circle In The Sand&quot; reached the top 10 position in many countries among them U.K. (#4), U.S. (#7) and Canada (#5).
