The first single, \u00abShadow Days,\u00bb Billboard calls \u00aba gentle and shimmering confluence of mellow Southern rock\u00bb.\n \n Mayer produced Born and Raised with Don Was, who worked on albums for acts such as the Rolling Stones, B.B. King and Bonnie Raitt. Rock legends David Crosby and Graham Nash provide vocals on the title song, \u00abBorn and Raised.\u00bb Musicians joining Mayer on the album and on the road include highly-regarded keyboardist/pianist Chuck Leavell who has worked with the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and The Allman Brothers Band as well as previous collaborators Sean Hurley on bass and Aaron Sterling on drums.\n \n Mayer\u2019s previous albums Room for Squares, Heavier Things, Continuum and Battle Studies have sold more than 12 million copies combined. He has been honored with seven Grammy Awards and an additional 11 nominations. He has also been included in Time Magazine\u2019s annual Time 100 list of the most influential contemporary thinkers, leaders, artists and entertainers, and twice been featured on the cover of Rolling Stone Magazine's annual \u00abGuitar\u00bb issue.\n \n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n \n The follow-up to 2009\u2019s Battle Studies, 2012\u2019s Born and Raised is singer/songwriter John Mayer\u2019s fifth studio album. Born and Raised was delayed during recording due to Mayer\u2019s treatment for granulomas found near his vocal cords. Following his surgery, Mayer completed the album and debuted the leadoff single \u00abShadow Days\u00bb in February of 2012. While Mayer was able to finish the album, a recurrence of his granulomas forced him to cancel his tour and abstain from singing indefinitely while he received further treatment. Co-produced by legendary musician Don Was and John himself, Born and Raised features more of Mayer\u2019s distinctive and soulful melodic rock with hints of country and blues\u2026\n \n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n \n \n TRACKLIST\n 1.
