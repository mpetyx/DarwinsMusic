Lyrically, the album visualizes Gaga's love of fame in general whilst also dealing with subjects such as love, sex, money, drugs and sexual identity. Promotion was primarily through The Fame Ball Tour and multiple television appearances. The Fame was included as a bonus disc on the deluxe edition of the extended play, The Fame Monster (2009).\n \n The album received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who commended the album's lyrical content and Gaga's musicianship and vocal ability, which have been compared to fellow pop singers such as Gwen Stefani. The album was a commercial success, topping the charts in different countries worldwide, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Poland and Switzerland. In the United States, it peaked at number two on the Billboard 200, while topping the Dance/Electronic Albums chart for 100 non-consecutive weeks. The Fame has sold more than 15 million copies worldwide.\n \n The first two singles from The Fame, &quot;Just Dance&quot; and &quot;Poker Face&quot;, gained international success, topping the charts in several countries worldwide, including the United States, United Kingdom and Australia. While its third single, &quot;Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)&quot;, experienced less commercial success, the next two singles, &quot;LoveGame&quot; and &quot;Paparazzi&quot;, were a commercial success as well, charting within the top ten of more than ten countries worldwide. &quot;Beautiful, Dirty, Rich&quot; was released in the form of a promotional single. The Fame has won multiple awards since its release. It was nominated for a total of six Grammy Awards at the 52nd Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. It won the Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album and the Best Dance Recording for the single &quot;Poker Face&quot;.It also won Best International Album at the 2010 BRIT Awards.In 2013, Rolling Stone named The Fame as one of the &quot;100 Greatest Debut Albums of All-Time&quot;.\n \n The Fame received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 71, based on 13 reviews.Matthew Chisling from Allmusic called the album &quot;a well-crafted sampling of feisty anti-pop in high quality&quot;, and wrote that it &quot;fails to come up short on funky sounds to amuse fans of this dance genre.&quot;Nicole Powers of URB complimented its &quot;irony-laden lyrics, delivered in a style that owes a little something to Gwen Stefani,&quot; as well as the album's &quot;deluxe ditties&quot;.Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly called it &quot;remarkably (and exhaustingly) pure in its vision of a world in which nothing trumps being beautiful, dirty, and rich. In this economy, though, her high-times escapism has its charms&quot;.Alexis Petridis of The Guardian found it &quot;packing an immensely addictive melody or an inescapable hook, virtually everything sounds like another hit single&quot;, and predicted that it &quot;certainly sounds like it could be big.&quot;Daniel Brockman from The Phoenix wrote that &quot;Gaga ups the ante in terms of catchy songwriting and sheer high-in-the-club-banging-to-the-beat abandon.&quot;Ben Hogwood of musicOMH praised Gaga's &quot;blend of sassy attitude, metallic beats and sharp, incisive songwriting&quot;, elements which he felt are integral to &quot;creating pop music&quot;.\n \n Although he panned &quot;Eh Eh&quot;, &quot;Paper Gangsta&quot;, and &quot;Brown Eyes&quot;, Evan Sawdey of PopMatters called The Fame &quot;a solid dance album&quot; and wrote that &quot;much of the album\u2019s success can be attributed to rising club producer RedOne.&quot;Joey Guerra from the Houston Chronicle felt that although the songs present in the album are not innovative, Gaga deserved credit for bringing real dance music to the mass.Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club felt that the &quot;whole point&quot; of the album is &quot;glitter-laced, dance-inciting energy that bodes well for extended club play&quot;.Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani viewed that Gaga's lyrics veer between &quot;cheap&quot; and &quot;nonsensical drivel&quot;, while her singing is &quot;uneven at best&quot;. He added that the highlights such as &quot;Poker Face&quot;, &quot;Starstruck&quot;, &quot;Paper Gangsta&quot;, and &quot;Summerboy&quot; rely &quot;almost solely on their snappy production and sing-along hooks.&quot;Freedom du Lac from The Washington Post criticized the album for lacking originality. MSN Music's Robert Christgau gave the album an &quot;honorable mention&quot; and quippedly referred to it as &quot;shallowness at its most principled.&quot;The Fame garnered five Grammy nominations at the 52nd Grammy Awards on December 2, 2009. The album itself was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Electronic/Dance Album.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "The Fame is the debut album by American pop singer-songwriter Lady GaGa.
