{"album": {"wiki": {"content": "Body Language is the ninth studio album by Australian recording artist Kylie Minogue, released on 20 November 2003 by Parlophone. After the huge success of Minogue's album Fever, Minogue announced she would start recording her ninth studio album. Several producers from previous albums were featured on the album.\n Body Language differs stylistically from Minogue's previous albums, diverging from her signature dance music. The album consists of mainstream pop music, but also incorporates elements of R&amp;B, funk, synthpop and hip hop music, even including rapping on the track &quot;Secret (Take You Home)&quot;. The title of the album also came from the song &quot;Slow&quot;. Body Language generally received mixed to positive reviews from critics, who praised Minogue for a more independent and risk-taking style, but also criticised the album for its differences.\n While Body Language failed to reach the chart and sales success of Fever, it still managed to chart inside the top five in several countries. It was certified Double Platinum in Australia, Platinum in the United Kingdom and Gold in Austria and Switzerland. In addition, the album had sold 177,000 units in the United States as of March 2011.\n The album spawned four singles, three official singles while one promotional. The album's biggest single &quot;Slow&quot; reached the top ten in most countries, peaking in Australia and the UK. The next single &quot;Red Blooded Woman&quot; was also successful, while &quot;Chocolate&quot; saw moderate success. Minogue promoted the album with a promotional concert titled Money Can't Buy.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Body Language is the ninth studio album by Australian recording artist Kylie Minogue, released on 20 November 2003 by Parlophone.
