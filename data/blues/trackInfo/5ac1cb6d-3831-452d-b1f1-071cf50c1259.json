Fuck I love Tom Waits.", "I can't figure out how to interpret the line \"the only way down from the gallows is to swing.\"  \n\nWhat do you guys thing?", "Over the years I have collected the entire works of Tom Waits on numerous different formats. I have played each album, live CD/record, b-side collection and movie over and over again. \n\nBut this track, 'Pay Me', is my favourite track by Tom Waits. It's incredible: after listening to his entire discography, that now lasts nearly 40 years, I can still find a track that leaves me breathless like this. \n\nTom Waits' best work has never been a case of reflecting on the past and talking about how he was. I really believe he gets better with age. You may have your favourite period of Tom Waits music but I really believe he is still progressing as an artist.", "so damn beautiful it breaks my heart.", "It's so beautiful.
