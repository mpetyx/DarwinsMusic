Originally performed by Larry Davis, it is arguably one of Stevie Ray Vaughan's most well known and revered tracks. It's long guitar solos has been ranked as number 13 on Guitar World's &quot;100 Best Guitar Solos&quot; list.\n \n Although &quot;Texas Flood&quot; has three verses of lyrics, the song is more of a prolonged guitar solo, allowing Vaughan to show off his characteristic electric blues style. During live shows, he would often play portions of this song behind his back, arousing an enthusiastic crowd response. Stylistically, &quot;Texas Flood&quot; is structured around the common three chord blues progression. Written and performed in the key of F#, it is in 12/8 time, or compound time, which gives it a &quot;slow burning&quot; feel that is common in Texas blues.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Texas Flood is the third track on Stevie Ray Vaughan's debut album Texas Flood.
