There won't be another either.", "-------------super gut --------------", "Little Walter plays the harp so fine ! great vocals too !!!", "NICE.", "One of the best blues introductions, all time.", "Nobody played the blues harp like Walter did!", "this is smoked goodness, i wanna take off a bit and move my hips;)", "HANDS DOWN THE BEST HARMONICA PLAYER EVER", "hands down the BEST", "Word!", "LITTLE WALTER WAS  PROBABLY THE MOST SAUGHT AFTER SOUND IN THE HISTOTY OF THE HARP WORLD. JUST LIKE JIMI HAD   SET THE BAR FOR THE GUTAIR GIANTS TO COME.THE REAL DEAL", "Did this fella record a duff song?!?!? A Legend!", "Interesting comment: now I think about it, I sense that amplification initially got its most interesting results out of the Harp. It took a Jimmy Hendrix to get the full results out of the guitar - or am I being unkind to the guitarists of the 1950s?", "Interesting comment. In many ways, amplification initially got more interesting results out of the Harp than out of guitars. Walter was a bit like a Jimi Hendrix?", "Electric guitar was too young to be generic when Walter contributed to Harp amplification. They happened simultaneously. And it became a harmonica world (you had to have one in your band if you played blues) in the 50's."], "toptags": {"tag": [{"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/blues", "name": "blues"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/harmonica%20blues", "name": "harmonica blues"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/chicago%20blues", "name": "chicago blues"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/bluezzz", "name": "bluezzz"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/ein%20super%20song", "name": "ein super song"}]}, "mbid": "118ee37b-3f30-4af6-a680-d6d84bdbd6ab", "duration": "182000", "playcount": "52962", "id": "4076964"}}
