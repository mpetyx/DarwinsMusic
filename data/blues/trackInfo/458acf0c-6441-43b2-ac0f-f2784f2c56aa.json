IT IS MORE BLUES TO ME 'COUSE OF THE SPEED OF THIS SONG", "The Blues!!they are a treasure unique to the South.

BBQ, cold beer, fried catfish; and all things that you people who are not fortunate to have grown up Southern can only imagine in your dreams.  By the way, if any of you are remotely interested in country music, you may be surprised to know that the person singing on this round with BB(Indianola, Ms.) is Marty Stuart(Philadelphia, Ms.) of the Grand Ole Opry fame and husband to coutry legend Connie Smith.", "first... to confess"], "toptags": {"tag": [{"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/blues", "name": "blues"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/blues%20rock", "name": "blues rock"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/classic%20blues", "name": "classic blues"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/chicago%20blues", "name": "chicago blues"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/guitar", "name": "guitar"}]}, "mbid": "458acf0c-6441-43b2-ac0f-f2784f2c56aa", "duration": "173000", "playcount": "43263", "id": "1588673"}}
