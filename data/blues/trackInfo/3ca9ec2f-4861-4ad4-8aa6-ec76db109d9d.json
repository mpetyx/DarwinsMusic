John Paul Jones played Hammond Organ on the song, using the bass pedals for the bassline. It was the only track from the third album that the band had played live prior to the recording sessions, but was reportedly the hardest to record. One story mentions Jimmy Page taking a break following a series of failed attempts to track the solo. Seemingly unable to get the tone he was craving, he set about a walk around the studio to clear his mind. Sitting outside of the recording area was an unplugged amplifier, which he utilised, and recorded the solo we hear today on the next take. Audio engineer Terry Manning called it &quot;The best rock guitar solo of all time.&quot;\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "The song was recorded live in the studio with very little overdubbing.
