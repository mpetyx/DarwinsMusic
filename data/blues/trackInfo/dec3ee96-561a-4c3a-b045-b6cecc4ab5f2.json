It's just two very different musical phases I went through in very different times of my life (like in Grade 6, I went through a Bette Midler/Carpenters/Barry Manilow phase and during high school and now in college I've been in love with Tom Waits, so it tickles my fancy to hear the combination of these two phases I went through.)", "There's an odd magic to this track.
