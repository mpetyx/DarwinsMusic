It was written in 1976 and first appeared as an opening track on album <em> \u201cSmall Change\u201d </em>.\n <em> Tom Traubert's Blues </em> is evidently based on the Australian hymn <em> Waltzing Matilda </em> (written by A.B. &quot;Banjo&quot; Paterson). But that doesn\u2019t mean that they deal with the same matter, the only thing similar in both songs is the chorus.\n Beacase of the chorus, by the way, this song is quite often mistagged  and referred to as <em> Waltzing Matilda </em>, which is of course wrong.\n The meaning of the song is very ambiguous and hard to define. Everyone seems to find his own personal explanation, but here are some of the most reasonable: <ul><li>\n </li><li> Some people claim that the song is about Vietnam and American soldiers taking drugs (<em>\u201cNo one speaks English and everything\u2019s broken\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m tired of all the soldiers here\u201d</em>) </li><li>\n </li><li> Others are sure, that the song is about a woman called Matilda and Tom\u2019s love for her. It turned out that in the 70s Tom Waits had been to Copenhagen and attended a concert of a Danish folk-singer \u2026Mathilde Bondo (surprise-surprise)!  The rumor says that \u201cafter the show she somehow met Waits, and they got along so well that they went out bar-crawling through Copenhagen, and finally ended up at his hotel room, drunk as skunks\u201d. And a few months later Tom sent her the \u201cSmall Change\u201d album as a memory of a good night. So maybe that\u2019s it?</li><li>\n </li><li> But there\u2019s also the third version. The point is that \u201cwaltzing Matilda\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily require a woman named Matilda and dancing skills. One of possible alternatives is\u2026travelling. The phrase might have originated with German immigrants who settled in Australia and roughly means \u201cto travel from place to place in search of work with all one's belongings on one's back\u201d. That makes perfect sense in such lines as <em>\u201cAnd it's a battered old suitcase to a hotel someplace\u201d</em> or <em>\u201cMatilda's the defendant, she killed about a hundred and she follows wherever you may go\u201d</em>. In this song \u201cwaltzing Matilda\u201d has become a metaphor for alcoholism, seduction and self-destruction. </li><li> </li></ul>\n But still remains a mystery the title of the song, at least its first part. Who is Tom Traubert? Other than this title Waits never referred to the character. Some people claim to have known Tom Traubert, some claim to be his only legal child, some claim to be Tom Traubert himself. Only Tom could give us a clue, but he won't. When a journalist supposed that it\u2019s the singer himself, Waits mentioned that Tom Traubert is his fellow who\u2019s now in prison. Other than this revelation \u2013 nothing.\n In conclusion, Waits seems to have some special feelings towards this song, because in the 1970's and 1980's he used to close his shows with this song, giving his audience some food for thought on their way home. And unlike most of his other songs, he kept it unchanged for over 30 years. It's finished, nothing to add, it doesn't get any better.\n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Tom Traubert\u2019s Blues (Four Sheets To The Wind In Copenhagen)   is one of the most famous songs of Tom Waits.
