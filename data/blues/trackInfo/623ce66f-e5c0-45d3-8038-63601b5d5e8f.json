On March 7, 1979, in a mutual symbol of reconciliation after conflict over civil rights issues, he performed it before the Georgia General Assembly (the state legislature). After this performance, the connection to the state was firmly made, and then the Assembly adopted it as the state song on April 24.\n tag radio : <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/georgia%20on%20my%20mind\">Georgia On My Mind</a>\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot; is a song written in 1930 by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/search?q=hoagy%20Carmichael%20on%20my%20mind&amp;type=track\">Hoagy Carmichael</a> (music) and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Stuart+Gorrell\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Stuart Gorrell</a> (lyrics).
