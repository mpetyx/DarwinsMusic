Stevie knocked over the mic stand and after some intense feedback, he picked it up and said \"I think they're mad at me\". Then he walked off stage. The crowd was booing and screaming and not at all pleased. After about 5-10 minutes, Stevie walked out on stage alone with his guitar. He sat on a stool and then proceeded to play the most soulful and gut wrenching version of Lenny I've ever heard. The crowd went nuts! All was forgiven and his band came back out and they started playing Voodoo Chile again and this go around, Stevie stayed in time with the band.", "Lovely tune and great number!!", "makes me want to lick my ears  lololol"], "toptags": {"tag": [{"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/blues", "name": "blues"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/blues%20rock", "name": "blues rock"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/guitar", "name": "guitar"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/guitar%20virtuoso", "name": "guitar virtuoso"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/instrumental", "name": "instrumental"}]}, "mbid": "0ef82b78-c088-4edf-a7b7-24939f6b2e0b", "duration": "307000", "playcount": "210844", "id": "1191408"}}
