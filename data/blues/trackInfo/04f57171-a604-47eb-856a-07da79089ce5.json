McTell's unique style was a blend of the Piedmont and Deep South genres of blues.  The 12-string guitar was his primary instrument, often with the use of a slide.  McTell was legendary for his ability to &quot;see&quot; despite his blindness:  making clicking sounds wherever he went, listening to the reverberations, and then negotiating furniture and other obstacles in his path.  He traveled great distances alone to perform and was able to provide comfortably for himself and his family.  McTell died in 1959.\n In the late 1960s, Taj Mahal performed and recorded the song with the late guitarist Jesse Ed Davis playing slide guitar.  A great interpretation in itself, it is also given credit for inspiring a young Duane Allman to learn  slide guitar.   Although different stories exist on exactly how Allman first heard the Taj Mahal/Jesse Ed Davis version, the impact on rock music cannot be overstated as Allman became the acknowledged master of slide guitar, inspiring countless others to adopt the style.   After he formed the Allman Brothers Band, &quot;Statesboro Blues&quot; became a signature song for the band.  Their 1971 album, &quot;Live at the Fillmore East&quot; included a scorching version of the song, with only the lyrics recognizable to the original McTell song.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Statesboro Blues,&quot; was written and recorded by Blind Willie McTell in the late 1920s, a tribute to his hometown of Statesboro, GA.
