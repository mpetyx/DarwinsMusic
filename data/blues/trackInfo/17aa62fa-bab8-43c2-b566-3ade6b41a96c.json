And the comment 'everyone who wants to seem kool says they love him' really just sounds as though you're someone who's trying to appear different for not actually liking him, aha.", "Cool", "Big, you're an idiot if you think Waits is any more a one trick pony than any of the old delta bluesmen you have in your library. Waits has played in more musical styles than most, and his albums are in general extremely diverse in sound.", "Waits gets boring after a while, no matter what he does it's the same tricks. Now he's just a fad and everyone who wants to seem kool says they love him. One-trick pony, folks.", "I wish this went on forever.", "Fuckin AAAAA!!!!", "this sax solo on glitter and doom is so amazing", "this man!", "\u2665", "The live album is re living the total exuberance and adrenaline  rushing joy of seeing this man live, watching his aura expand to the size of the theater , breathing in his charisma. One of the most phenomenal entertainers on this planet at this time. One of the greatest poets and writers...explore his world if you haven't yet you will bring back great treasures from the deep.", "I love sax", "Indeed the Glitter & Doom version is made of awesome and gold! Those drums with their BANG-dakadak!", "Shiiiiiiiit the Glitter & Doom version is insane. The intro sounds like 80s Bowie, and that sax solo is absurd!", "Now this is a lovesong.", "i agree", "God, l heard this song for the first time 15 years ago. I was 15 then and very impressionable, thought Tom Waits was god.
