The song rails against racism, classism, and discrimination in general, with such verses as &quot;The home of the Brave / The land of the Free / I don't wanna be mistreated by no bourgeoisie&quot;.\n \n Lead Belly recorded the Bourgeois Blues numerous times, first on December 26, 1938, accompanied by himself on his 12-string guitar. It should be noted that in all but the earliest recording of the song, the original line &quot;Some white folk in Washington / they know just how, call a colored man a nigger just to see him bow&quot; was altered to &quot;give a colored man a nickel just to see him bow&quot;, presumably to avoid causing offense. The song has been recorded by many other artists, most notably <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pete+Seeger\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Pete Seeger</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ry+Cooder\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Ry Cooder</a>.
