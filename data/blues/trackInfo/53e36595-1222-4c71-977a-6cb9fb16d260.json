It's clearly representing Tom's actual childhood, and needless to say, it was a much different time back then. I can't really relate to the lyrics, as most of my generation probably cannot, but I most definitely understand the sentiment of them. And the nostalgia is heartbreaking.", "Warning this song will break your heart!\nFirst heard this some 30 years ago.  The raw emotion still gets me every time. Everything about this track is just right. Tom\u2019s voice the musical arrangement and the beautiful lyrics. \nWonderful.", "Dieses Lied l\u00e4sst meinen K\u00f6rper angenehm erschauern...", "one of these songs that will prevent you from killing yourself", "The most beautiful and incredible song about childhood memories, games and make-believe ever written.  My favourite Waits song by a long, long way.", "oh my god. i'm getting misty-eyed. those strings. the way he sings. that beautiful piano playing. surely one of the greatest songs ever. i've sometimes been derided because i never cry at films, but this is the closest i've ever come to crying at music. i don't even know what he's singing about. i just know it's sad. so, so sad. incredible.", "this is it. this is why i listen to music.", "<3", "For me, the most beautiful song ever sung.", "Heart-stopping; magnificent.
