To say the crowd  was rowdy was an understatement. Always will remember a penned real buffalo getting loose during their gig and a poor wrangler/handler getting dragged out in the outfield holding on to     it's tail. And no,lol I wasn't trippin' at the time. It really happened. ~Smiles~", "This is another version than the original Fandango - still good!", "Texans like ZZ, SRV, and Don Walser (don't know about Don?) are one reason Texas ought to be its own country", "Billy F- ing Gibbons!!!", "Perfect song for driving through the night in your car all alone :) Same goes for many blues songs. B.B. King does an awesome job on giving you that special road-atmosphere.", "***THANKS J\u00dcRGEN***", "ZZ Top play the Blues, great", "\u2665", "Any truth to their being the\"Club Stash Band\" for the BANDITOS MC?", "I wish they would put out a live album every yrear.", "STILL GOOD BUT NOT OFF FANDANGO", "i likie zztop alot", "Heh, I don't wear blue jeans.", "woderful song", "Baby.....bring em back!!!!!", "You can always expect them to take a shirt or something, but not your jeans! That aint right...", "Anyone can recognize thier own old blue jeans! I can always tell if they are mine.. Saw these guys with cowboy hats and no beards long time ago. Still the best!", "Takes me back > 1975 ... Lake Charles, LA ... before they grew the beards!
