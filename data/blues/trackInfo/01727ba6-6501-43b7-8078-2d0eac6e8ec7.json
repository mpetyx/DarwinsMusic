He first recorded the song on the 1967 album Axis: Bold as Love. It is ranked #357 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of &quot;the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;, and has been covered by numerous artists, notably Derek and the Dominoes, Joe Satriani, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Pearl Jam, Sting, John Mayer, The Corrs, Toto among many others.\n \n &quot;Little Wing&quot; is played using the unique chord/melody guitar style that Hendrix developed during his early career stints in rhythm and blues bands. In this style, the guitar sounds as though it is playing two parts. This is done by simultaneously playing multiple complementary notes, often parts of chords, and then changing a note within the chord to create a melodic effect. Other songs played in this style include &quot;Life Without You&quot; by Stevie Ray Vaughan, &quot;Catch The Rainbow&quot; by Rainbow, &quot;When A Blind Man Cries&quot; by Deep Purple &quot;The Boy From Seattle&quot; by Steve Vai, &quot;Yellow Ledbetter&quot; by Pearl Jam, and &quot;Under the Bridge&quot; by Red Hot Chili Peppers. The unusual flanging sound of the lead guitar part is a result of the Doppler effect which is created using a rotating speaker cabinet, or Leslie speaker.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Little Wing is a song written by Jimi Hendrix.
