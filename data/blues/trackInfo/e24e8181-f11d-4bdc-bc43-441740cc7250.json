I heard Live From Nowhere... in a media store and bought it right then and there, first time I ever did that. Then in December 08 I had the opportunity to meet and interview him in Cologne Germany, The man behind the stage is soft spoken and looks very young but when he enters the stage all of that changes! He becomes someone else with the smoken' voice and a familiarity with his guitar akin to a lover. His live show is full of great riffs and action!"], "toptags": {"tag": [{"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/blues", "name": "blues"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/blues%20rock", "name": "blues rock"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/guitar", "name": "guitar"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/mj%20-%20my%20bluez%20time", "name": "mj - my bluez time"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/77davez-all-tracks", "name": "77davez-all-tracks"}]}, "mbid": "e24e8181-f11d-4bdc-bc43-441740cc7250", "duration": "260000", "playcount": "50511", "id": "114690999"}}
