He has got the fine style, taste and refinement.", "Essence of slide guitar goodness!", "Love his style and ability!! Amazing musician and terrifically talented slide guitarist!! Just a 'Word to wise'; the new Tedeschi and Trucks album 'Revelations' was a disappointment for me! I don't understand how they could have collaborated so well before, only to play rather underwhelmingly on so many of the cuts. A few are fun, but most just seem to display much less fire than their usual work. Hope their other efforts are up to their normally stellar efforts!", "Toad Lick alligator swamp music.", "True to the blues, yet doing so many new things, all so extremely well!!! Derek is a superb slide guitar player and every band he plays in is better for having him there!!!", ":-)", "the more i listen to this the more i am just\"sold\".", "seen this youngster play down south more yrs ago than i want to admit to or can remember talk about bringin back the best of the good ol memories", "I'd love to front this band!   I saw Derek when he was 12!", "You can hear the history in their sound.love it...<3 also love Susan (Derek's wife)", "I completely agree with Bagel. Live version is mind-blowing!", "Great song, one of their best!", "There is an AMAZING live version of this track on their new album Roadsongs. Wonderful album!!", "oh i'll be the one wearing blue jeans and white t shirt", "im going to see him oct 1, only an hour away. lucky me!!!!!!!!!!!", "cool slide guitar!!!!!!", "...cool [2]"], "toptags": {"tag": [{"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/blues%20rock", "name": "blues rock"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/blues", "name": "blues"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/trucks", "name": "trucks"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/southern%20rock", "name": "southern rock"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/rock", "name": "rock"}]}, "mbid": "9c690b62-6dba-4772-bda4-32e999721406", "duration": "299000", "playcount": "83727", "id": "244206988"}}
