Now I think since his voice changed his voice is legendary.", "with almost 60 million plays labelling tom waits as misunderstood is BS", "so damn good", "reminds me of a Blind Willie Johnson song.", "Listen to some delta blues or some such thing and you will find that their voices sound like they drank too much, stayed up too late, are running from the man and sleeping out in the cold, cold rain. If they sang with some golden voice it would suck badly and we would send them back to their fancy million dollar mansions and luxury recording studios to make music for wussies.", "<333", "one of the most beautiful songs on the earth<3", "C\u00f3mo me gustas, Tom.", "Pretty sure mitch26 was being ironic.

That's all.", "mitch26, of course you are allowed your opinion on music, but to suggest that Rod Stewart would do a better version of this song shows me that your musical soul is dying.
