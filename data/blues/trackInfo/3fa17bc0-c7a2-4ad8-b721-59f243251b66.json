The song was originally released on 78 rpm format as Vocalion 03475, ARC 7-04-81 and Conqueror 8871. There is an ongoing dispute as to whether the song was originally written by Johnson or by his contemporary, bluesman <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Elmore+James\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Elmore James</a>.\n \n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Elmore+James\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Elmore James</a> made his first recording of &quot;Dust My Broom&quot; for the Trumpet Records label in 1951. James followed <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Robert+Johnson\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Robert Johnson</a>'s melody quite closely. His lyrics are based on Johnson's first four verses, but with <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Arthur+Crudup\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Arthur Crudup</a>'s changes to the verses about his 'good gal'. This 1951recording has James on electric slide guitar, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sonny+Boy+Williamson+II\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Sonny Boy Williamson II</a> on harmonica, Leonard Ware on bass and Frock O'Dell on drums. Ware supplied the boogie beat, allowing James, with superior amplification, to dominate with a riff based on Johnson's triplet figures.\n \n The record became a surprise rhythm and blues hit in 1952, prompting James to exploit the melody and accompaniment with similar texts. Most of his subsequent records were released as by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Elmore+James+&amp;+His+Broomdusters\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Elmore James &amp; His Broomdusters</a>. His releases included: &quot;She just won't do right (Going for good or Dust My Broom)&quot; (1952) and &quot;Dust My Blues&quot; (1955). In 1959 he recorded the song again as &quot;Dust My Broom&quot; with his cousin <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Homesick+James\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Homesick James</a> on second guitar. Homesick later recorded the song on an LP for Vanguard Records in 1965. Distinctive to all these records is the melody created from the riff on &quot;Dust My Broom&quot;\n \n James' version of &quot;Dust My Broom&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Dust My Broom&quot; is a blues standard originally recorded as &quot;I Believe I'll Dust My Broom&quot; by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Robert+Johnson\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Robert Johnson</a>, the Mississippi Delta blues singer and guitarist, on November 23, 1936 in San Antonio, Texas.
