There's a book on Skip James by Steven Calt called \"I'd Rather Be The Devil\".  Skip played in open Dm (aka \"Spanish\") tuning.  Skip also played piano.  Never heard a voice anything like it.  Magnificent.  My favorites are Cypress Grove and Crow Jane.", "first time for me .great voice", "that voice, those slides, somebody sure had the blues", "This god damned tune made me buy a new guitar.
