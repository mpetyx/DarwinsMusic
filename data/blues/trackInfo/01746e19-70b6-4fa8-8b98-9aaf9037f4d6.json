On this version, Noel Redding plays electric guitar tuned to resemble a bass guitar. Despite Hendrix's complaints, the song was omitted from the USA compilation release of the album because the recording company reportedly argued that &quot;America does not like blues&quot;.\n \n While playing the song at Woodstock, Hendrix snapped his high E-string in the middle of the performance and kept playing the second half of the song with just five strings. &quot;Long&quot; versions of the song like the Woodstock rendition are generally about 6-10 minutes. One of the longest recorded versions of the song is his nearly thirteen-minute long version at the San Diego Sports Arena, which is found on Hendrix in the West, a live album sampling four different shows.\n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "'Red House' is a Blues song (specifically a slow 12 bar blues close to the Chicago style), written and first performed by famed guitarist Jimi Hendrix.
