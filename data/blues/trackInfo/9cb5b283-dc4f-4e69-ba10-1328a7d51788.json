It was included as a track on Cream's final album, <a title=\"Cream - Goodbye\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Cream/Goodbye\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Goodbye</a>. Peaking at number 60 on Billboard's Hot 100, &quot;Badge&quot; was a minor hit after its release as a single in April 1969. The single was much more successful in the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/place/United+Kingdom\" class=\"bbcode_place\">United Kingdom</a>, where it reached #18.\n \n &quot;Badge&quot; was originally an untitled track. During the production transfer for the album Goodbye, the original music sheet was used to produce the liner notes and track listing. The only discernible word on the page was &quot;bridge&quot; (indicating the song's bridge section). Due to Harrison's handwriting, however, Clapton misread it as &quot;badge&quot; \u2014 and the song was titled soon thereafter.\n \n Harrison remembered the story slightly differently: &quot;I helped Eric write 'Badge' you know. Each of them had to come up with a song for that Goodbye Cream album and Eric didn't have his written. We were working across from each other and I was writing the lyrics down and we came to the middle part so I wrote 'Bridge.' Eric read it upside down and cracked up laughing-- 'What's BADGE?' he said. After that, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ringo+Starr\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Ringo Starr</a> walked in drunk and gave us that line about the swans living in the park.&quot;\n \n A common legend or misconception is that the name came about because its chord progression is B-A-D-G-E (it is not) or simply because an anagram of a guitar's standard tuning (E-A-D-G-B-E) can be arranged to spell &quot;Badge&quot;.\n \n The arpeggiated guitar part in the song's bridge resembles some of Harrison's contemporary Beatles riffs, including &quot;<a title=\"The Beatles &ndash; You Never Give Me Your Money\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/You+Never+Give+Me+Your+Money\" class=\"bbcode_track\">You Never Give Me Your Money</a>&quot;, &quot;<a title=\"The Beatles &ndash; Here Comes the Sun\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Here+Comes+the+Sun\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Here Comes the Sun</a>&quot; and &quot;<a title=\"The Beatles &ndash; Carry That Weight\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Carry+That+Weight\" class=\"bbcode_track\">Carry That Weight</a>&quot;. The guitar part also strongly resembles that of Ringo's solo effort &quot;<a title=\"Ringo Starr &ndash; It Don't Come Easy\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ringo+Starr/_/It+Don%27t+Come+Easy\" class=\"bbcode_track\">It Don't Come Easy</a>&quot; (written in collaboration with Harrison). Harrison himself, however, has stated that he didn't play the aforementioned riff on &quot;Badge&quot;.\n \n In the U.S.A., <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/label/ATCO\" class=\"bbcode_label\">ATCO</a> Records' initial releases of Goodbye and of &quot;Badge&quot; as a single gave the song's writing credit to Eric Clapton alone, with publishing credit to Robert Stigwood's company Casserole (BMI). ATCO would correct this later in 1969 with the release of Best of Cream, which lists both Clapton and George Harrison as the song's authors.\n \n The U.K. single of &quot;Badge&quot; released by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/label/Polydor\" class=\"bbcode_label\">Polydor</a> Records gave writing credit to both Clapton and Harrison, with publishing credit going to Dratleaf and Harrisongs Ltd. Since the early 1990s the writing credit has been listed as Clapton/Harrison with publishing credit going to E.C. Music, Ltd. and Harrisongs.\n \n Despite his contribution to the song's lyrics, Ringo Starr is not credited as a co-author of &quot;Badge.&quot;\n \n Original Goodbye performers:\n \n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Eric+Clapton\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Eric Clapton</a> \u2013 lead guitar and vocals\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jack+Bruce\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Jack Bruce</a> \u2013 bass guitar and backing vocals\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ginger+Baker\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Ginger Baker</a> \u2013 drums\n Felix Pappalardi \u2013 piano and mellotron\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/George+Harrison\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">George Harrison</a> (credited, for contractual reasons, as &quot;L'Angelo Misterioso&quot;) \u2013 rhythm guitar\n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Badge&quot; is a song performed by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Cream\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Cream</a>, written by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Eric+Clapton\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Eric Clapton</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/George+Harrison\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">George Harrison</a>.
