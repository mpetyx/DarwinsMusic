In his works there are a lot: surprise, a farce, a holiday, a lot of bright color, sensuality. In his works we feel the harmony with the classic performance. Each tune is the whole story, but not even the moment of life.", "Awesome!!!!!", "What is the main symbol of freedom? Clearly this is a road. The road is something that allows come away and return back, leave and meet again. Joe gave us \u0430 freedom!!!!", "Blues it is So Many Roads. It is such roads. Through the darkness, through fear, through your own nightmares. If you live in the chest pain and you sing, you play it - you display it out on the world. Drive yourself to the light. So the blues is the real magic. Bonamassa is a real, true magic", "Love it", "One of the best. Right up there with Duane Allman, Eric Clapton and Stevie Ray Vaughan", "Best out of You&Me.", "This is one smokin' track....", "One of my favorites of Joe's!! I think 'Bridge to Better Days' is my top one, though!!", "Super Gitarrenspieler und inzwischen ist seine Stimme noch besser\ngeworden", "Joe has the soul of Les Paul.", "Super!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Candy for the soul.", "The BEST!!!!", "Joe now owns, not 1 but 2  59 Les Paul's - and plays them on tour - Joe has a new album #13 - Driving Toward The Daylight - out in May this year - Also  going to another BCC album - and an Acoustic album and gigs later in the year. Not to mention his new DVD - Live at the Beacon NYC - out now.  Joe is one busy boy!", "Super Song. Bonamassa einer meiner Favoriten, wenn es um das Gitarrenspiel geht. Der wird immer besser.
