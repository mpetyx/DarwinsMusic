The song, which appeared on the B-side of You Make Me Real, was first released as a single from the album Morrison Hotel in March 1970 and peaked at #50. The song quickly became a concert staple for the group, a live version appearing later on the posthumous album An American Prayer and that same version, which has been called &quot;probably one of the best live performances of any song&quot;, again on In Concert and Greatest Hits. During this version, Jim Morrison talks for a short while to a female audience member about his Zodiac sign and, with a sudden, ironic twist that causes the audience to erupt in laughter, denounces his beliefs in it. The song was also featured twice in the movie The Doors; the studio version in the film, and the aforementioned live version over the end credits.\n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "&quot;Roadhouse Blues&quot; is a blues-rock song written and recorded by the American rock band The Doors.
