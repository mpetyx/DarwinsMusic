Good grief he/they were smokin' hot.   This dude is supra-human to be perfoming/writing this great, at any age, let alone someone turning 80 this Nov.   Go hear/see them if you ever get the chance.  A worthwhile treat.   Rocky Athas another guitar virtuoso with John.  Rhythm section of Greg Rzab and Jay Davenport is worth studying LIVE on their own.   Hard to keep your eyes on anyone.  Thanks to John for a million hours of listening to his music.", "stevie does a good version of this....srv", "good sound....", "Great cover thanks to John and Eric!\nwww.jackybullfrog.com", "great song, great band.  Kudos to Otis Rush, of course, the originator.  But for me this cover is pretty freakin' wonderful.
