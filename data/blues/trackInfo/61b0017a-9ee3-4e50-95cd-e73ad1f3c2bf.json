His guitar is powerful and inviting in a way that makes you want to hear more. He also has the ability to create an exciting atmosphere anywhere. He can deliver his message on a broadly appealing level with a sincerity that comes through every note and every word.", "The Blues At Sunset (Live At Wattstax And Montreux) version is seriously the best version I've ever heard.
