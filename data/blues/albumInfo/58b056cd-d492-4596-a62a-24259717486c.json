There has never been anything quite like it, before or after, and when one has heard Muddy Waters from this period, one has simply heard the best blues has to offer.\n \n <strong><em>The Best of Muddy Waters</em></strong> is a 1958 greatest hits album by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Muddy+Waters\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Muddy Waters</a> released by Chess Records in April 1958. With gaining popularity for 33 &amp; 1/3 rpms (commonly called LPs) Chess Records started releasing its first LPs in 1958. The Best of Muddy Waters (released sometime in April 1958 according to Billboard magazine) was the third LP that Chess released.\n \n The profile of Muddy Waters on the front of this album is a classic bit of color portrait photography. The bluesman seems to be staring up at something, a glazed look of wonder in his eyes. What could it be? Perhaps a vision of all the different \u201cbest of\u201d sets and repackagings of his material that would happen in the future. In the end, it comes down to \u201cThat Same Thing\u201d that Waters used to sing about, although he was talking about something else. The material this artist cut for Chess during this period is nothing short of a blues revelation. There has never been anything quite like it, before or after, and when one has heard Muddy Waters from this period, one has simply heard the best blues has to offer. This collection was the first \u201cbest of\u201d Chess created, obviously mindful that what they had on their hands was nothing less than a tray of gold. The earliest pieces, such as \u201cLouisiana Blues,\u201d are just marvelous, the country blues slide guitar augmented just so slightly by string bass, the harmonica of Little Walter, and the barest trace of percussion. Rhythmically, these performances are flawless and drenched with the feel as if they were slabs of chicken that had spent the day simmering in a jerk sauce. From there, one hears the classic Chicago blues combo sound emerging, which it does with great glory on tracks such as \u201cStanding Around Crying.\u201d Yet with all the more extensive material that has been released of this artist since the late 50s, it is hard to conceive of why a consumer looking for Waters would settle for this collection. It is not a question of \u201cless is more,\u201d as there is great consistency to the Watersdiscography from this period; listeners who enjoy this material will want more, more, more.\n \n Review by Eugene Chadbourne/AMG\n \n <strong>Track listing</strong>\n \n All songs written and composed by All songs written by McKinley Morganfield, except where noted.\n Side one\n \n     1. \u201cI Just Want to Make Love to You\u201d (Willie Dixon) Chess #1571 2:49\n \n     2. \u201cLong Distance Call\u201d Chess #1452 2:38\n \n     3. \u201cLouisiana Blues\u201d Chess #1441 2:49\n \n     4. \u201cHoney Bee\u201d Chess #1468 3:20\n \n     5. \u201cRollin\u2019 Stone\u201d Chess #1426 3:05\n \n     6. \u201cI\u2019m Ready\u201d (Dixon) Chess #1579 3:01\n \n Side two\n \n     1. \u201cI\u2019m Your Hoochie Coochie Man\u201d (Dixon) Chess #1560 2:49\n \n     2. \u201cShe Moves Me\u201d Chess #1490 2:54\n \n     3. \u201cI Want You to Love Me\u201d unknown 3:01\n \n     4. \u201cStandin\u2019 Around Cryin\u2019\u201d Chess #1526 3:19\n \n     5. \u201cStill a Fool\u201d unknown 3:14\n \n     6. \u201cI Can\u2019t Be Satisfied\u201d Aristocrat #1305 2:41\n \n <strong>Personnel</strong>\n \n     Muddy Waters \u2013 lead vocals, guitar\n \n     Ernest \u201cBig\u201d Crawford \u2013 bass on \u201cLong Distance Call\u201d, \u201cLouisiana Blues\u201d, \u201cHoney Bee\u201d, \u201cI Want You To Love Me\u201d, and \u201cI Can\u2019t Be Satisfied\u201d\n \n     Willie Dixon \u2013 bass on \u201cI Just Want To Make Love To You\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m Ready\u201d, and \u201cI\u2019m Your Hoochie Coochie Man\u201d\n \n     Little Walter \u2013 harmonica on tracks A-1, A-2, A-3, A-6, B-1, B-2, and B-4; guitar on B-5\n \n     Walter \u201cShakey\u201d Horton \u2013 harmonica on B-3\n \n     Jimmy Rogers \u2013 guitar on tracks A-1, A-4, A-6, B-1, B-3, and B-4\n \n     Otis Spann \u2013 piano on A-1, A-6, B-1, B-3, and B-4\n \n     Fred Below \u2013 drums on A-1, A-6, and B-1\n \n     Elgin Evans \u2013 washboard on A-3; drums on B-3 and B-4\n \n     Leonard Chess \u2013 bass drum on B-2 and B-5\n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "The material this artist cut for Chess during this period is nothing short of a blues revelation.
