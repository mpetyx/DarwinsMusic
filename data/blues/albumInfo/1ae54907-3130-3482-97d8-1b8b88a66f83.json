{"album": {"wiki": {"content": "    Recorded between 1966 and 1970, they feature the master guitarist stretching the boundaries of electric blues in both live and studio settings. Besides several Hendrixblues-based originals, it includes covers of Albert King and Muddy Waters classics, as well as a 1967 acoustic version of his composition \u201cHear My Train a Comin\u2019.\u201d\n     - Richie Unterberger / Allmusic Guide (4/5 Stars) -\n \n <strong><em>Blues</em></strong> is a posthumous compilation album by musician <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jimi+Hendrix\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Jimi Hendrix</a>, released April 26, 1994, on MCA Records. The album contains eleven blues songs recorded by Hendrix between 1966 and 1970. Out of these eleven, six were previously unreleased. The tracks include seven of Hendrix\u2019s compositions along with covers of famous blues songs such as \u201cBorn Under a Bad Sign\u201d and \u201cMannish Boy\u201d. Most of the album\u2019s material consists of leftover studio tapes that Hendrix might have never intended to release.\n \n Compiled by MCA and released in 1994, Blues was met with favorable criticism and multiple chart success, selling over 500,000 copies in its first two years of release. On February 6, 2001, Blues was certified platinum in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America. The album was re-released on Experience Hendrix Records in 1998, following the Hendrix family\u2019s acquisition of the musician\u2019s recordings.\n \n <strong>Music</strong>\n \n The opening song \u201cHear My Train A-Comin\u2019\u201d (aka (by Hendrix) \u201cGetting My Heart Back Together Again\u201d)) is a Hendrix original that he often played live in concert, particularly in 1969 and 1970. The song was from a long lost master tape of Hendrix alone playing a 12 string acoustic right hand guitar, strung for left hand and singing in a delta blues manner. This live studio performance was filmed for, and included in the film See My Music Talking, and later included in the 1973 documentary Jimi Hendrix and accompanying soundtrack LP. The last song on Blues is a live version of \u201cHear My Train A-Comin\u2019\u201d recorded on May 30, 1970, at the Berkeley Community Theater that had previously been released on the posthumous Rainbow Bridge album in 1971.\n \n A different version of \u201cHear My Train A-Comin\u2019\u201d was included on the posthumous 1975 album Midnight Lightning and was considered somewhat controversial since producer Alan Douglas used session musicians to augment Hendrix\u2019 guitar and Mitch Mitchell\u2019s drums (overdubbing the bass guitar in the process). Another studio version from February 1969 was included on The Jimi Hendrix Experience box set in 2000.\n \n \u201cBorn Under a Bad Sign\u201d is an instrumental jam of the Albert King number (performed by Band of Gypsys). \u201cRed House\u201d is the original (mono) take from the European version of Are You Experienced, but minus the outro chat (previously unavailable in USA &amp; Canada). Another take (stereo) from a different session was released on the USA version of the 1969 compilation album Smash Hits. On this version Redding plays electric guitar tuned down to resemble a bass. \u201cCatfish Blues\u201d is from a Dutch TV show Hoepla. Hendrix uses the first two verses from Muddy Waters \u201cRollin\u2019 Stone\u201d (which is based on older versions usually with \u201cCatfish\u201d in the title) and the last verse is from Muddy\u2019s \u201cStill a Fool\u201d itself based on \u201cRoll and Tumble Blues\u201d by Hambone Willie etc.\n \n \u201cVoodoo Chile Blues\u201d is another creation of Alan Douglas, recorded during the sessions that produced the finished track, \u201cVoodoo Chile\u201d, for the critically acclaimed Electric Ladyland album. This track is made up of two different takes of the song that were edited and joined together in order to come up with one consistent track. \u201cMannish Boy\u201d is actually a hybrid of Muddy Waters\u2019s \u201cMannish Boy\u201d and Bo Diddley\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m a Man\u201d, it is a similar edited studio creation that combines several takes. \u201cOnce I Had a Woman\u201d is a slightly longer edited version of Hendrix\u2019s slow blues song. The band starts to jam during the second half of the long song and then a fade out follows. \u201cBleeding Heart\u201d is a cover of the Elmore James number, performed here by Band of Gypsys. \u201cJelly 292\u2033 is actually take 2 of the song \u201cJam 292\u2033 (the name on the tape box) which appeared on the 1974 European only LP \u201cLoose Ends\u201d. It is an uptempo jam based on Duke Ellington\u2019s \u201cDooji Wooji\u201d. \u201cElectric Church Red House\u201d is a jam from TTG studios in 1968 featuring a group introduction by Hendrix (lifted from another, different jam at TTG) and Lee Michaels on organ.\n \n <strong>Musicians</strong>\n \n     Jimi Hendrix \u2013 guitars, vocals\n     Billy Cox \u2013 bass on \u201cBorn Under a Bad Sign\u201d, \u201cMannish Boy\u201d, \u201cOnce I Had a Woman\u201d, \u201cBleeding Heart\u201d, \u201cJelly 292\u2033 and \u201cHear My Train a Comin\u2019 (Electric)\u201d\n     Noel Redding \u2013 bass on \u201cRed House\u201d, \u201cCatfish Blues\u201d and \u201cElectric Church Red House\u201d\n     Mitch Mitchell \u2013 drums on \u201cRed House\u201d, \u201cCatfish Blues\u201d, \u201cVoodoo Chile Blues\u201d, \u201cJelly 292\u2033, \u201cElectric Church Red House\u201d and \u201cHear My Train a Comin\u2019 (Electric)\u201d\n     Buddy Miles \u2013 drums on \u201cBorn Under a Bad Sign\u201d, \u201cMannish Boy\u201d, \u201cOnce I Had a Woman\u201d, \u201cBleeding Heart\u201d\n     Jack Casady \u2013 bass on \u201cVoodoo Chile Blues\u201d\n     Steve Winwood \u2013 organ on \u201cVoodoo Chile Blues\u201d\n     Lee Michaels \u2013 organ on \u201cElectric Church Red House\u201d\n     Sharon Layne \u2013 organ on \u201cJelly 292\u2033\n \n <strong>Additional personnel</strong>\n \n     Alan Douglas \u2013 production\n     Bruce Gary \u2013 production\n     Mark Linett \u2013 engineering\n     Joe Gastwirt \u2013 mastering\n     Rob O\u2019Connor \u2013 artwork, design\n     Richard Bull \u2013 artwork, design\n     Michael J.
