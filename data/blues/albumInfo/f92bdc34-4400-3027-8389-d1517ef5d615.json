It was the first LP release of producer Robert Stigwood\u2019s new \u201cIndependent\u201d Reaction Records label, released in the UK as both a mono and stereo version on 9 December 1966, the same time as the single release of \u201cI Feel Free\u201d. The album was released a month later, in January 1967, in the United States by Atco Records as both a mono and a stereo version.\n \n In 2003, the album was ranked number 101 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n <strong><em>Fresh Cream</em></strong> represents so many different firsts, it's difficult to keep count. Cream, of course, was the first supergroup, but their first album not only gave birth to the power trio, it also was instrumental in the birth of heavy metal and the birth of jam rock. That's a lot of weight for one record and, like a lot of pioneering records, Fresh Cream doesn't seem quite as mighty as what would come later, both from the group and its acolytes. In retrospect, the moments on the LP that are a bit unformed -- in particular, the halting waltz of &quot;Dreaming&quot; never achieves the sweet ethereal atmosphere it aspires to -- stand out more than the innovations, which have been so thoroughly assimilated into the vocabulary of rock &amp; roll, but Fresh Cream was a remarkable shift forward in rock upon its 1966 release and it remains quite potent. Certainly at this early stage the trio was still grounded heavily in blues, only fitting given guitarist Eric Clapton's stint in John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, which is where he first played with bassist Jack Bruce, but Cream never had the purist bent of Mayall, and not just because they dabbled heavily in psychedelia. The rhythm section of Bruce and Ginger Baker had a distinct jazzy bent to their beat; this isn't hard and pure, it's spongy and elastic, giving the musicians plenty of room to roam. This fluidity is most apparent on the blues covers that take up nearly half the record, especially on &quot;Spoonful,&quot; where the swirling instrumental interplay, echo, fuzz tones, and overwhelming volume constitute true psychedelic music, and also points strongly toward the guitar worship of heavy metal. Almost all the second side of Fresh Cream is devoted to this, closing with Baker's showcase &quot;Toad,&quot; but for as hard and restless as this half of the album is, there is some lightness on the first portion of the record where Bruce reveals himself as an inventive psychedelic pop songwriter with the tense, colorful &quot;N.S.U.&quot; and the hook- and harmony-laden &quot;I Feel Free.&quot; Cream shows as much force and mastery on these tighter, poppier tunes as they do on the free-flowing jams, yet they show a clear bias toward the long-form blues numbers, which makes sense: they formed to be able to pursue this freedom, which they do so without restraint. If at times that does make the album indulgent or lopsided, this is nevertheless where Cream was feeling their way forward, creating their heavy psychedelic jazz-blues and, in the process, opening the door to all kinds of serious rock music that may have happened without Fresh Cream, but it just would not have happened in the same fashion as it did with this record as precedent.\n \n <strong>LP Track Listing</strong>\n \n     A1 I Feel Free -- 2:52\n     A2 N.S.U. -- 2:44\n     A3 Sleepy Time Time -- 4:20\n     A4 Dreaming -- 2:00\n     A5 Sweet Wine -- 3:18\n     A6 Cat's Squirrel -- 3:05\n     A7 Four Until Late -- 2:06\n     A8 Rollin' And Tumblin' -- 4:42\n \n     B1 I'm So Glad -- 3:58\n     B2 Toad -- 5:10\n     B3 Spoonful -- 6:37 (LP bonus track)\n     B4 Wrapping Paper -- 2:22 (LP bonus track)\n     B5 The Coffee Song -- 2:44 (LP bonus track)\n     B6 Rollin' And Tumblin' (mono) -- 4:42 (LP bonus track)\n \n \n <strong>Notes</strong>\n     Limited edition, 180+ pure virgin vinyl analogue pressing.\n     Remastered by Steve Hoffman on all vacuum-tube cutting system.\n     <strong>Contains bonus tracks (B3-B6).</strong>\n     The noise in N.S.U. is on master tape.\n     I'm So Glad was originally mixed to mono only.\n \n \n <strong>Personnel</strong>\n \n Cream\n     <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Eric+Clapton\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Eric Clapton</a> - guitar, vocals\n     <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jack+Bruce\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Jack Bruce</a> - vocals, bass, harmonica, piano, cello\n     <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ginger+Baker\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Ginger Baker</a> - drums, percussion, vocals\n \n <strong>Production</strong>\n     Robert Stigwood - Producer\n     John Timperly - Engineer\n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "Fresh Cream represents so many different firsts, it\u2019s difficult to keep count. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Cream\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Cream</a>, of course, was the first supergroup, but their first album not only gave birth to the power trio, it also was instrumental in the birth of heavy metal and the birth of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/jam%20rock\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">jam rock</a>.\n - Stephen Thomas Erlewine/AMG (4/5 Stars) -  Fresh Cream is the debut studio album by British supergroup Cream.
