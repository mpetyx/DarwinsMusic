{"album": {"wiki": {"content": "One of music\u2019s most powerful female voices and one of the world\u2019s greatest guitar players come together on the new album Don\u2019t Explain, featuring soulful covers that both celebrate and rethink the original recordings. Each known for their potent and expressive blues-rock sounds, Beth Hart and Joe Bonamassa deliver scorching versions of ten classic songs first made famous by artists including Billie Holiday, Etta James, Tom Waits, Ray Charles, Delaney &amp; Bonnie, Bill Withers, and Aretha Franklin. \n \n The album was recorded live in the studio over the course of four days in early 2011, with producer Kevin Shirley (Joe Bonamassa, Led Zeppelin, Black Crowes) capturing the raw energy generated by Hart and Bonamassa\u2019s spirited collaboration. As charged as the tracks are, Hart also colors her interpretations with tenderness and vulnerability, adding nuance in equal measure to passion. \u201cBeth\u2019s got a pretty heady voice, very reminiscent of Janis Joplin, and she\u2019s also got a lot of Etta James in her, but hadn\u2019t really accessed it yet,\u201d says Shirley. \u201cWith this material, there is a gentleness to the way she delivers the most heartfelt tunes that she hasn\u2019t shown before.\u201d \n \n Hart and Bonamassa are both based in L.A., but their collaboration grew out of the friendship they developed after crossing paths on the road numerous times, particularly when traversing the festival circuit in Europe. \u201cI was, of course, a big fan of his,\u201d says Hart. \u201cI played a show in London in early 2010, and heard through the grapevine that he was there, though I didn\u2019t see him.\u201d Bonamassa also remembers the show\u2014\u201cIt was killer,\u201d he says. When they bumped into each other in Holland soon after, Hart recalls, \u201cHe mentioned we should do a project together.\u201d \n \n What evolved from that encounter was the idea for Don\u2019t Explain, which Bonamassa came up with during the recording of his latest album, Dust Bowl, in Santorini, Greece in summer 2010. \u201cI was up late one night, I couldn\u2019t sleep. I was playing songs on my iPod from the reissue of Get Yer Ya-Ya\u2019s Out, which included all the opening acts from that Stones show,\u201d he says. \u201cAs soon as the Ike &amp; Tina Turner tracks came on, I just said out loud, \u2018Beth Hart.\u2019 I e-mailed Kevin, saying, \u2018Let\u2019s do a soul covers record with Beth,\u2019 and he replied back, \u2018Actually, that\u2019s a great idea.\u2019\u201d Hart agreed, though she says, \u201cWhen I got the call that he wanted to do a soul record with me, I figured I\u2019d be the background singer. He said \u2018no, you\u2019re singing lead.\u2019\u201d Bonamassa says, \u201cBeth has been an absolute hidden gem. She was a beautiful voice, she\u2019s a fantastic singer. I wanted her front and center.\u2019 \n \n Hart, Bonamassa, and Shirley considered a long list of songs before distilling it down to the set featured on Don\u2019t Explain. \u201cIt was exciting to go through all the music, songs by Billie, Aretha, Etta,\u201d says Hart. \u201cI\u2019ve been so influenced by them. I was raised listening to that music. My mother had a beautiful voice, and those are the songs she liked to sing.\u201d Of the tracks recorded, some were songs Hart knew she wanted to do going in, others were ones chosen by Shirley and Bonamassa that she was less familiar with. \n \n \u201cIt was a little unnerving at the beginning. I would have rather done all songs I knew well, but it ended up being fantastic,\u201d Hart says. \u201cMy nervousness inspired me to find a way to live up to these wonderful songs. I was touring when I learned the material, but I\u2019d listen to them over and over as we were traveling. I knew that to go into the studio with the level of players that would be there, including Joe, I really had to rise to the occasion. I couldn\u2019t do my best\u2014I had to do better. That kind of focus was good, and humbling. I wanted to make the best record ever.\u201d \n \n To back Hart up, Bonamassa assembled the band that was heard on his #1 Blues album The Ballad of John Henry (2009): Anton Fig (drums, percussion), Blondie Chaplin (guitar), and Carmine Rosas (bass), as well as Arlan Scheirbaum (keyboards). \u201cThe first day of recording,\u201d recalls Hart, \u201cI was so nervous I broke out in hives, realizing I was playing with such great musicians.\u201d She quickly hit her stride, though, and the sound evolved into a simmering mix of soul, jazz, rock, and blues, with Hart\u2019s vocals confidently in the pocket of each and every groove, her voice wrapping around the lyrics with grace and emotional intensity. \n \n Throughout the preparation for and making of Don\u2019t Explain, Hart feels she grew as an artist by virtue of listening to so many classic performances so many times, and then finding her own relationship to the songs. \u201cFor me, it couldn\u2019t have been better timing than to do a soul-based record now, and to do it with Joe. His playing is genius,\u201d says Hart. \u201cIt was a fantastic experience.\u201d \n \n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "One of music\u2019s most powerful female voices and one of the world\u2019s greatest guitar players come together on the new album Don\u2019t Explain, featuring soulful covers that both celebrate and rethink the original recordings.
