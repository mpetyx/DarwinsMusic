This track is pure.", "This could quite possibly be one of my favorite songs. I mean, it seems everytime I listen to it I get the same elation as I did the very first time I heard it.", "\"leeks\" as in wiki-leeks?", "Formless, empty, impenetrable.  This track is as close as Ambient 4/On Land comes to Eno's original conception of ambient music:  it's sound that seems suited for the background and can be listened to or ignored at your discretion.  It conjures up no images, evokes no memories, and calls to mind no tales.  Rather, it's an attempt to reckon with the natural world understood as something independent of human beings and largely indifferent to us.  We're unable to project our human concerns and conceptions onto this world in order to understand and master it.  These sounds can't be used for our purposes (as we might use the natural sounds in new age fluff), nor do they suggest that the natural world is a danger to us (as the earlier, more ominous tracks on the album seem to suggest).  Here we encounter a natural world that's simply there, a world that exists in and for itself.", "Reminds me more of dusk in a Bornean jungle than in a Suffolk woodland. Still superb!", "Divine", "feels good. brings back memories...", "I often crave these sounds. I listened to Eno a lot just before my daughter was born in 98.", "Good climax", "what album is this from?", "It's all in the BASS!", "alucinante depuis toujours", "Classic Eno. The bass drops kill me every time.", "~", "It's amazing what great music Brian Eno can produce using almost no sound.", "Sweetsweet"], "toptags": {"tag": [{"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/ambient", "name": "ambient"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/minimal", "name": "minimal"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/experimental", "name": "experimental"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/atmospheric", "name": "atmospheric"}, {"url": "http://www.last.fm/tag/intelligent%20ambient", "name": "intelligent ambient"}]}, "mbid": "44590882-6230-453f-b9ea-9d268736e7b3", "duration": "321000", "playcount": "143467", "id": "40020"}}
