Ripatti started with huge dub pieces in laptop free time -- he's a trained percussionist -- and moved slowly and reluctantly into microhouse and music with straighter beats.  I've loved him from the beginning (1995).", "Accidentally (or not), the clicks give this arrangement another dimension: the sense of subliminal disorder. It's what intrigued me to it in the first place. Mind you, I've never heard of this cat until falling upon this joint. Also intrigued by atmospheric synths and the underlying noises as well as the very filtered and almost unnoticeable drum beat that's blended beautifully. Sparked a few membranes, enjoyed this one a lot!", "No clicks on the proper version. Go get the album!", "\"madhatt3r111 wrote: the clicks are unnerving.
