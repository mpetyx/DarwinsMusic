Like 'kaiserzeitgest' says, it really goes somewhere.", "@kaiserzeitgeist\nthis is very true. i completely agree with you. this is the reason why i have shifted my focus a little away from minimal. anyway minilogue remains one of my favourite.", "i'm deeply impressed. thx for this amazing track!", "The thing that's really cool about this track in my view is how it really goes somewhere. It has a very distinctive beginning, middle and end and the climax is multi-tiered, it really rises. The problem with many minimal tracks which I otherwise like is that they really don't make any kind of journey. They pretty much stay the same with very little serious variation. Now then, this is not to say that they don't have rich colors and textures, but they aren't contrasted with equally rich colors and textures in a developmental structure quite like this track. I think all minimal artists could learn a great deal about making more interesting and exciting music by considering the architecture of this track.", "An awful track in my estimation. I\u2019m sure Albrecht D\u00fcrer would agree. The B-side is far more listenable\u2026", "The ultimate minimal track. Period.", "great tune; open air & nature", "Great Song, one of the best..!", "love it", "Yeah, monster track indeed. Panoramic, multi-faceted and endlessly growing. Fucking crazy shit.", "repeat. repeat. repeat...", "echt monster track!", "*dancing in my livingroom, spilling my thea*", "again, damn!
