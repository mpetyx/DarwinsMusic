I think, ultimately, it stands on its own as a lovely piece.", "yes. quite lovely.", "lovely", "Good, but very much in the tradition of  Reich  (and some aspects of Riley, I'd add). I agree with spilled_milk on that . Sounds very much like a minimalist piece from the 70's (or early 80's) to me. Not particularly fresh, though nicely executed, and easy on the ears.", "steve reichesque", "Simply gorgeous.", "Kept me from strangling the boss...good stuff.", "sehr gut", "Extremely soothing.", "I have listened to this a few times, and, admittedly it passed by without leaving much of an impression.  But in this listening, three seperate times I have stopped doing what I was doing to look up at the monitor and note to myself that I liked what I was hearing.
