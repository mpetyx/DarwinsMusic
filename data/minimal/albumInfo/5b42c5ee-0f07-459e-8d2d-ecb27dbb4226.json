House music that is delicately crafted from disco-ball shards. House music that filters vocals through space-age parabolics. House music that transcends the dancefloor and leaps into your eardrums. House music will never be the same, until he returns, again.\n \n Paper Tigers penetrates so deeply because the finer points of Delay\u2019s sound are thrown at you with unrelenting vigor and rapidity; they attack like objects of blunt force while retaining the form and style that can only come from master craftsmanship. The overall experience is immediate and disarming. In a way it is showmanship taken to a musical extreme; Delay discards some incredible beats and melodies in a few bars that could lay the foundation for a truly epic dance tune. Imagine you are driving through a magical forest, and the trees have speakers that are blasting your favorite Luomo tracks. But every speaker is like a half second off the one before, and you\u2019re driving really fast with the windows rolled down. That chopped, amazing, interesting sound you hear? That\u2019s Paper Tigers.\n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "He continued to pioneer the new house sound with the release of the smooth and sexy &quot;The Present Lover&quot; (2003) \u2013 but &quot;Paper Tigers&quot; calculates a future house.
