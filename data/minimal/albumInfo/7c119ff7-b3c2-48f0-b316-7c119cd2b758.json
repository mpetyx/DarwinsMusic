Using nothing more complex than several tape recorders and overdubs, Riley created a genuine one-off triumph. Hard to classify at the time and probably still is.\n \n After several graph compositions and early pattern pieces with jazz ensembles in the late \u201950s and early \u201960s (see \u201cConcert for Two Pianists and Tape Recorders\u201d and \u201cEar Piece\u201d in La Monte Young\u2019s book An Anthology), Riley invented a whole new music which has since gone under many names (minimal music \u2014 a category often applied to sustained pieces as well \u2014 pattern music, phase music, etc.) which is set forth in its purest form in the famous \u201cIn C\u201d (1964) (for saxophone and ensemble, CBS MK 7178). \u201cRainbow in Curved Air\u201d demonstrates the straightforward pattern technique but also has Riley improvising with the patterns, making gorgeous timbre changes on the synthesizers and organs, and presenting contrasting sections that has become the basic structuring of his works (\u201cCandenza on the Night Plain\u201d and other pieces). Scored for large orchestra with extra percussion and electronics, some of this work\u2019s seven movements are: \u201cStar Night,\u201d \u201cBlue Lotus,\u201d \u201cThe Earth Below,\u201d and \u201cIsland of the Rhumba King.\u201d\n \n -- \u201cBlue\u201d Gene Tyranny Allmusic.com (9/10) --\n \n <strong>LP Track listing</strong>\n A1 A Rainbow In Curved Air (18:44)\n B1 Poppy Nogood And The Phantom Band (21:39)\n Total Time: (40:03)\n \n <strong>Credits</strong> \n Side 1: Electric Organ, Electric, \u2018Rocksichord\u2019 Harpsichord, Goblet Drum (Dumbec), Tambourine: Terry Riley\n Side 2: Soprano Saxophone, Electric Organ: Terry Riley\n \n Engineer: Glen Kolotkin, Roy Segal\n Producer: David Behrman\n Artwork: Virginia Team (Columbia LP Back), John Berg (Columbia LP Front)\n \n \n        \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL.", "summary": "A Rainbow In Curved Air is <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Terry+Riley\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Terry Riley</a>\u2019s masterpiece of ambient music from 1969, before the term itself was even coined.
